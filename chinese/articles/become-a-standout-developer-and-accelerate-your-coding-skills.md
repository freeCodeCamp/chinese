技术拥有无穷的挑战让我们去应对。

你会的构架会改变。你最熟悉的工具会进化。技术会迈进或退流行。你会为了兴趣而转到技术的某一个部门。

在工程行业工作代表着你会一直学习新的东西，保持新鲜的技能。

5年前，Angular 是非常受欢迎的。大部分的前端工作都想要 Angular 的技能，现在市场变了。 React 超越所有前端构架，成为最火红的新技术。

5年前，Rails 是非常受欢迎的。 现在 Node 和 Python 在职务描述上遥遥领先。

保持新鲜的技能是主要元素之一，那会让你在众多的工程师当中脱颖而出，营造一个持久的事业生涯。

但是，这或许也是在你事业刚开始的时候比较有挑战性的。我还记得我当时看着所有我要学的东西，大家讨论我不懂的新技术而感到愤怒。

每次我感觉我可以胜任一个构架的时候，就会有另外一个变得受欢迎。 我感觉我永远都赶不上。

但是那也是做工程师最好的部分 – 你永远都不会感觉到无聊。那也是一个可以帮助你在竞争里脱颖而出的工具。

一个开发者的学习方式是跟你到学校学习完全不一样的。会有一些阅读，一些课程。但最主要的时间是建设。

## 从做中学习

小时候，你是从做中学习。

你先学会讲话，虽然不是完整的句子。从做中学会画画。你是婴儿的时候没有读过有关的书。你没有读过“婴儿手指绘画101教学”。

先学会爬再走。这才帮助你快速驾驭新的概念。你永远都在 —— 做。

通常，在工程里面，概念会因为建设而保存，而不是死背。

当我刚开始做工程师的时候，我不断阅读书本和做抽认卡。我用了无数的时间制造抽认卡。我以为买了一本新书或网上课程就会教会我自己怎么编程，然后变成工程师巨星。但是这并没有发生。

回想起来，我不确定那些抽认卡会有什么作用。

花了几个月时间熟背句法和定义, 我还是在原地。 只有开始建设的时候，技能才开始进步。

在热爱阅读工程书籍的同时，我大部分的时间会花在略读一本书，然后立刻尝试新的概念。

这是一个比较痛苦的学习方式。我不会骗你 —— 挺可怕的。 但是没有什么能像亲自建设一样，帮助建设新的编程技能。最快的速度学习就是建设。

但你怎能办到呢?

## **逃离教学地狱**

当我学习怎么编程的时候， 我花费了几个月的时间跟随网上教学。 我会一边看教学，一边跟着每个步骤的做。 永远都不会尝试着靠自己。

如果教学太难的话，我会换另外一个。我会每天花几个小时再看教学。

我尝试过用我在大学学习的方式，用在编程里。但并没有用。学习编程是要活跃的学习，不是被动式的。

但是模仿网上教学挺容易的。我永远都不会觉得愚蠢或感觉到冒牌者症候群。我会最终觉得很有成就感。

与其同时，我会盲目的跟随着影片，而不会学到任何东西。我不会逼迫自己。如果你想要学一门新的技能的话， 你一定要逼迫自己往前进。

6个月过去了，徘徊在教学地狱里面，享受着那里的温暖天气，舒适圈。我发觉到我没有学到任何东西。我没有任何的技能。我太重视抽认卡和被动式的看网上教学，多过于建设任何东西。

与其同时， 早已经开始建设方案的朋友们会在我身旁略过，他们的学习速度快到难以置信。

我会感到很愤怒。我连建设一个基础的程式都不会。如果不是在一个同步网上教学里面，我真的不会。直到我开始建设小型的程式，我才被点醒。

若感到舒适的时候，马上远离网上教学。教学只是刚开始的时候才好。但是，到某一个程度，那只会把你的学习缓慢，特别是如果你是太过依赖的话。

这可以应用在你整个事业的途中。如果你是一个初级工程师，选一个小小的方案。不要用网上教学。尝试自己了解怎么建设。不要气馁，不成功没关系！从小方案开始做起来。

还有，如果你是一位拥有很多年经验的工程师，而想要从后端工程转做机器工程话，选一个小方案开始编程吧。

## **永久学习**

另一个可以让你变成一个出色的开发者的技能是当一个永久的学习者。

当你刚开始学习着编程的时候，每天的素材非常多。你不断的吸取新的概念。要学的知识好像无止尽似的。

在理想的世界里，无论你当了工程师多久，你还睡永远的学习新的东西。始终会找到平衡的。

你会开始觉得在工作上变得很舒适，然后抱怨自己的技能怎么好像凝滞似的。 很快就会感觉到无聊。

保持技能敏锐会帮助你工作稳固，就算景气不好的时候。

以下是几个可以让你永久学习的方法。

-   写编码，常写
-   跟比你优秀的开发者合作
-   如果感觉被耽误的话，要求在工作上换队
-   贡献 open source 的方案
-   参加会议和讲座
-   订阅通讯
-   开始在Twitter跟开发者交流
-   不断的阅读
-   建设方案
-   考新的文凭
-   上网上课程
-   休息。年休假是不可以带到棺材里面的。
-   阅读部落格
-   找导师
-   分享知识
-   写部落格

以上会有些是你不可以在你的空挡的时间做的。没关系。 我们都会有私生活。专住在工作上学习，像换团队，找导师，或成为一位导师，等等。

成为一位出色的工程师不代表要无时无刻的编程。编程是一个工作。这是你朝九晚五。但是你可以选择在你工作上成为一个建设者。

当你在学一个新的技能的时候， 远离书籍和课程。尝试在工作上找一个任务可以用的上你想学的新技能。这样会帮你快速的学会技能。

## **适应非舒适区**

在学习新技能的时候，你要逼迫自己。让你适应非舒适区。

当工程师前，看教学感觉很容易。我会很少感觉到疲倦。我会用 Codecademy 和其他频道，然后觉得我有进步。但是我没有。

6月过后，比起刚开始的编程路程里，我并没有前进。 我还是很初级。

当我刚开始担任初级软件工程师的时候，我是在一个持续的恐惧状态。我感觉我有做不完的工作。那是一个很恐怖的感觉。我突然间比以前学快很多。我脑袋像一个海绵一样。

寻找机会成长。如果你继续做同样的事情的话和待在舒适圈，你永远都寻找不到机会成长。If you take on the same tasks at work and continuously work on the same things, you won’t be pushing yourself and growing.

Always be  _biting off more than you can chew_. If you spend all your time taking tutorials, it will begin to feel routine and it won’t be a challenge anymore. And you won’t be learning.

However if you choose to push yourself, you’ll learn faster. You’ll be uncomfortable which means you’ll be growing.

Much as if you were practicing piano, if you kept practicing the same piece over and over again because you were confident with it, you wouldn’t be improving your skills by learning more challenging pieces.

The same principle applies to most things in life.

When I was trying to get my first dev job, I had to decide between a position at Apple and an apprenticeship at a small startup.

The role at Apple was going to pay more and I knew other people who worked there so I would have built-in friends and a support system. However, it was half QA and half engineering, with the opportunity to move to full time engineering if things went well.

The startup job was unstable at best. Nothing was guaranteed. They didn’t have another engineer who identified as a woman at the company. I would be the only woman in the entire engineering team.

Not to mention – this  _wasn’t_  a job offer! It was an offer for a three month apprenticeship with no guarantee that I would have a job after. I would have to move to the city, sign a lease, and hope that I could somehow afford the rent if I failed the apprenticeship.

And this was back when coding bootcamps were at the largest point of the bubble. Students were graduating in San Francisco and the market was more saturated than ever before. Job postings frequently included “No bootcamp grads” which was highly discouraging.

I knew if I started at Apple, it would be good for my resume. I’d be making more money as well. But I couldn’t stop thinking about growth and mentorship opportunities that the startup offered me.

Sadly, I had no idea what to do. I had been sold the idea of a high paying dev job during my coding bootcamp. Not a low paying apprenticeship that might not even lead to a job.

I ended up accepting the three month apprenticeship. Most of my friends thought I had lost it. My own family thought I had lost it.

I suddenly had three months to prove myself at the apprenticeship. I quickly lost count of how many weekends and late nights I worked. I was  _terrified_.

The pace was fast and I was blown away by how little I knew. I felt so nervous some days that I wanted to call in sick. I would fantasize about my train getting delayed underground so I would be forced to miss work. Every standup felt like torture because I felt I wasn’t doing enough.

Meanwhile, friends that attended the same bootcamp as I had were discussing their cushy entry level jobs at Apple and how they got to leave at a reasonable hour every day. Not to mention, they were paid so much more!

After the first two months my manager asked to have a meeting about the apprenticeship. I was convinced they were going to fire me.

Instead they told me that they were ending the apprenticeship program a month early and they were going to offer me a full-time software engineering position at the company. I can’t describe how happy I was that day.

I continued throwing myself into my work. I would volunteer for tasks that I didn’t feel ready to complete. If I didn’t know how to do something, I would say I could do it anyway. A year and a half after that, I was a senior software engineer at the same startup.

Would it have been easier if I accepted the position at Apple? Absolutely. But the engineers I knew that accepted the Apple position never had a mentor like I did to push them and challenge them to improve their skills.

In the long term, they ended up spending more time recovering from the lost learning early on. Some are still stuck with the same entry level title years later.

Depending on your goals, that might be fine for you. And that’s okay. But I wanted to become a standout developer with an exceptional career. And I’m guessing if you’re reading this, so do you.

Was it risky to accept the startup job? Absolutely. Most people thought it wasn’t a good move. But I chose to be uncomfortable and it paid off. Did it feel comfortable? Absolutely not. I probably aged five years in that role.

Choose  _discomfort_. The biggest most rewarding success in life happens after hard work. Put down the tutorial and pick up a task you don’t know how to solve.

## **Deep Work**

Coding is a job that requires deep concentration. Switching context to check your phone or social media platforms will be detrimental to the amount of work you can get done in a given day.

Most people will work for a few minutes and then check their phone. If the average employee spends 8 hours working each day, and spends two hours or more being unproductive, you can quickly become known as an engineer who gets things done by simply spending your work hours  _actually_  working.

By building a habit of focus and deep work, you’ll become an engineer that stands out from the crowd. Creating this habit will also show that you have an impenetrable work ethic.

How long can you go without checking your phone or Facebook or Twitter? Five minutes? Ten? Fifteen?

If you haven’t read it, pick up a copy of  [Deep Work][1]  by Cal Newport. Start small. Try to focus on one task for 20-25 minutes without interruptions. Put your phone on airplane mode, close all unnecessary tabs and put a big sign on your door that says ‘DO NOT DISTURB.’

Start building this time up. Try to work up to a 45 minute uninterrupted session. In such a distracted world, the ability to do this is rare and the amount of work you’ll find you can suddenly get done in a short time will be shocking.

There are many apps that use the Pomodoro technique that can help you stay focused. Try to experiment with a few and see what works for you.
