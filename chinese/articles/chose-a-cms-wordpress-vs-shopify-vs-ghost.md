![How to Choose a CMS – WordPress vs Ghost vs Shopify](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2022/01/WordPress-vs-Ghost-vs-Shopify.jpg)

WordPress、Shopify和Ghost是最强大和最流行的CMS平台之一。

你可能想知道为什么这么多人使用它们。嗯，这是因为它们易于使用，成本效益高，而且效率高。

使用WordPress、Shopify和Ghost，你可以在几分钟内从头开始创建一个网站。

根据你的需要，这些[强大的网站建设工具](https://www.weblime.com/stories/top-website-builders)可以帮助你实现从建立电商网站到开始你自己的博客或展示你的投资组合的任何目标。

这么多企业选择这些平台。但你应该选择哪一个？

我们不能简单地说，一个比另一个好，因为没有一个解决方案能在所有情况下发挥作用。

因此，在这篇文章中，我们将介绍这三个平台，并看看它们的优点和缺点，以便你能弄清楚什么会对你的特定情况最有效。

## 如果你想从头开始建立一个博客--使用Ghost

如果你是一个正在寻找开源平台的博主，[Ghost](https://ghost.org/)可能是你的完美选择。

它是开源的,使你能够改变平台的代码，对其进行定制，使其更适合你的写作需要。

即使你不是一个程序员，你也可以从其他用户那里得到帮助，他们愿意通过修复错误或增加新功能来为社区做出贡献。

网上有关于如何在自己的服务器上安装Ghost的教程。你也可以选择使用托管计划，这允许你使用其他用户创建的主题，而不是依赖默认主题。

Ghost是一个基于Node.js的平台，它使用Node.js服务器运行。它有一个丰富的插件系统，允许你定制你的博客以满足你自己的需求。

Ghost让你使用Markdown而不是HTML进行写作。这使你很容易直接在浏览器窗口中写作。

如果你不了解Markdown，它是一种轻量级的标记语言，允许你用富文本写作，但代码更简单，与HTML相对应。

事实上，与其他平台相比，Ghost的好处之一是你的文章是用Markdown写的，而不是HTML或文本文件，这导致代码更简洁。

### 你可以将Ghost作为一个无头CMS使用

Ghost有一个灵活的架构，这意味着它可以作为一个无头CMS使用。事实上，它是JAMStack中最受欢迎的无头内容管理系统之一。

一个[无头CMS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-headless-cms-explained/)允许你建立一个前端网站或应用程序，如一个移动应用程序，有一个调用CMS的数据的API。你可以将API和你的网站或应用程序部署到不同的服务器或环境中，而不必改变你内容中的任何东西。

由于API从CMS提供数据，你将完全控制这些数据，包括权限、标签和类别。如果你需要对你的内容进行修改，你将只需要在一端进行修改，而不是在两端。

无头CMS通常用于使用AngularJS和React.js等JavaScript框架构建网站和应用程序。然而，如果你需要用一个API调用来渲染一个有多个页面的动态网站，这种类型的CMS也是有益的。

要使用无头CMS，你需要学习它的工作原理，以及如何通过其API来利用它。这可能需要额外的开发资源，这取决于你的技能水平。

这种方法在初创企业和机构中越来越受欢迎，他们希望对内容的显示有更多的控制，同时仍然保留通过中央界面(central interface)进行更新的能力。

### 使用Ghost的优势

Ghost是一个免费的、易于使用的CMS，不需要任何种类的编码技能。

除了简单之外，Ghost CMS还具有很多开箱即用的功能，这使它对博主和小企业非常有吸引力。

你可以添加多个作者，设置合作写作，跟踪分析，创建民意调查，客户支持论坛，管理模板，以及更多使用拖放功能的功能。

当你开始在Ghost上使用第三方应用程序时，事情变得很有趣。有许多集成可用于安装谷歌分析和Discuz评论等应用程序。

其他一些优点包括:

- **它有一个干净、简约的设计**。如果你想让你的博客变得漂亮，那么Ghost CMS就很适合。
- **完整的工具**。你可以得到创建博客所需的所有工具，从安装开始到用拖放功能设置主题。
- **可定制的主题**。主题可以使用内置的主题编辑器进行定制，这使得任何人都可以根据自己的需要修改它们。
- **Ghost社区**。如果你被卡住了，你可以通过翻阅Ghost的论坛和提问，从其他Ghost用户那里找到帮助。

## 如果你想让你的网站更上一层楼--使用WordPress

You can use [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) as a simple blogging platform, but it is also a fully-featured content management system (CMS). It allows you to build custom websites and blogs if you want to take your business to the next level.

Because of its popularity, there is an active support community and lots of free training materials.

Tutorials for the basic functionality and more advanced features are widely available online.

WordPress is free, but if you need help installing it or customizing it for your needs, you can purchase web hosting from a reputable company. Hosting costs vary depending on the type of hosting service you choose.

[You can install WordPress yourself](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-started-with-wordpress/) or pay someone to do it for you. The WordPress website provides instructions on how to install the software on different server platforms.

Once installed on your server, WordPress will allow you to create your own blog page. You have complete control over the look and feel of your site through the use of themes, which are pre-built designs for the layout of your pages.

Themes are available for purchase or free download from the WordPress website. You can also [design your own custom theme](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-how-to-create-your-own-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/) if you're up to the challenge.

You might want a more complicated site than what is provided by the basic WordPress installation. In that case, you can hire a designer to build you a customized theme or using an existing theme as a framework and add your own custom features through plugins. Plugins extend the features of themes with special design elements and programming functions.

### Advantages of using WordPress

WordPress is by far the most customizable option in this list. It features the most comprehensive library of themes and plugins, allows you to edit the source code quite easily, and even write your own custom functionalities.

You can think of WordPress as the CMS that falls between Ghost and Shopify, as it allows you to run an eCommerce store and a blog at the same time by simply installing a compatible theme.

WordPress lets you take your blog to the next level and scale your eCommerce store as your business grows.

The downside is that sooner or later you will need a developer’s help. This is because the more plugins you install, the slower your website will get, and users hate slow websites (not to mention search engines).

Some other pros include:

- **Extremely cheap to get started with**. You can get a WordPress website up and running for free, and basic hosting plans start as low as $18.96 per year.
- **Ability to assign user roles**. At some point during your business growth cycle, you might need to bring in extra people to help you create, edit and publish content. WordPress comes with built-in user roles which will make your life a whole lot easier.
- **Best marketing plugins on the market**. You can install one of the many SEO plugins available in the plugin directory. Some examples include Yoast or Rank Math. These plugins help you optimize your content (like articles, pages, and even product pages) and increase your chances of outranking your competitors.
- **A vast array of integrations**. Chances are you will be using 3rd party SaaS products like Mailchimp or ActiveCampaign. Regardless of the service, you will find it extremely easy to integrate them with your website as almost all have created a WordPress plugin.
- **The biggest online library of resources**. The WordPress community is by far the largest which makes it easy to find answers to all your questions regarding your installation. There are tens of thousands of websites and forums focused solely on WordPress websites featuring tons of information.

## If You Want the Fastest Way to Start an eCommerce Business – Use Shopify

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) started in 2006 as an online store for snowboarding equipment. Back then, the CMS ecosystem was lacking a robust and easy-to-use solution, so the Shopify creators decided to code their own.

Needless to say, this was a hit. In the years that followed more and more stores have started to use the Shopify CMS. As of May 2021, more than 1.7 million businesses from some 175 countries use Shopify to run their businesses.

By far the simplest and fastest way to start an eCommerce business, Shopify is mainly used by nontechnical people that want to bring their brick and mortar stores online. In no more than a few minutes you can have your own website up and running and start accepting online payments.

But Shopify is also used by some of the biggest online stores on the Internet, which makes it a great option if you want to scale your business to the next level, and have the funds to do so.

Some of Shopify’s advantages:

- **Extremely easy to get started with**. The CMS was built with ease of use in mind. Anyone can get a store up and running in no time. You don’t have to know how to code or even how to connect a domain to your website as Shopify does all that for you.
- **Compatible with most major third-party services**. Shopify connects out of the box with the biggest third-party services, like Klaviyo for email marketing or Facebook Ads for paid advertising.
- **Plenty of apps in the app store**. If you feel that your store needs additional functionality, like bundle discounts, for example, you will be happy to hear that there are tons of apps that can help you achieve this. Just be careful and look at their cost as they can go up rather quickly.

Some of Shopify’s disadvantages:

- **Can get pretty expensive**. Shopify is extremely easy to start with, but that comes with a cost. The cheapest plan (Basic) starts at $29 per month, while the most expensive one (Advanced) reaches $299 per month. The main difference is the commission applied by Shopify on payments.
- **High payment fees**. You have to take into account that Shopify charges up to a 2% fee on your transactions (on the Basic plan). This commission decreases with the plan to a minimum of 0.5% (on the Advance plan). In comparison, WooCommerce doesn’t charge you a percentage of your sales.
- **Shopify developers are expensive**. If you want to customize your store beyond basic functionalities you will need the help of a developer, and they are not cheap. However, there are a multitude of apps available that can help you achieve your goals.
- **Most Shopify Apps have a monthly cost**. You can find free apps in the app store, but most of them have a monthly cost (compared to a fixed one-time fee charged by the vast majority of WordPress plugins).
- **The blog functionality isn't great**. Shopify is an eCommerce-centric platform so there’s no wonder that they haven’t spent too much time optimizing their blog functionality. Big stores choose to host their blogs on WordPress while keeping their storefront on Shopify.

In conclusion, you can use Ghost to start your blog almost instantly, or Shopify to configure a fast and secure online store. And, if you want to get the best out of both worlds, you might want to go with WordPress.
