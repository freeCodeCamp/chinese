## Why Computer Literacy is Important

We live in a digital world, and that doesn't seem to be changing any time soon.

On the contrary, each year, technological advancements and breakthroughs occur.

Despite the rapid growth of the Internet and technologies surrounding it, more than a third of the world's population doesn't have access to the Internet and has never used it.

Having access to it and owning a personal computer is a privilege in and of itself.

Many people also still lack the digital skills needed to use the Internet.

At the same time, there are unfulfilled jobs due to a lack of a skilled workforce.

The work we do – and will do in the future – relies heavily on digital media and tools.

So, basic computer skills are considered the bare minimum requirement by employers, with computer skills often being the top requirement listed in job postings.

And no matter the industry you are in, you will need computer skills.

Whether you work in healthcare, retail, finance, as an administrative assistant, or the HR department of a company, digital competency will be helpful.

Digital literacy will give you a higher chance of getting career opportunities and achieving growth in the modern workplace.

## Software Skills Guide

Before continuing, I want to give a disclaimer.

In the sections to come, I will go over some of the most used software programs utilized in office jobs.

Depending on your job, or the career you want to transition into, you may not need knowledge of all of this.

For example, if you are an administrative assistant, you probably won't use the command line for your day-to-day tasks.

If you are a software developer, you won't necessarily be writing Excel formulas.

That said, knowledge of computer software will put you one step forward compared to someone lacking that knowledge.

So, even if you're not in tech, you can still benefit from using the command line to make repetitive manual tasks quicker. And if you are a software developer, you won't be writing only code all day. You will probably use a word processor for documentation and will need to know how to create presentations.

Another thing to add is that the list is quite long, with many programs included. It's not intended to be an exhaustive list. Instead, it's for providing a general idea of what could help make you more productive and competitive.

Learning all the software will take time, and you don't need to learn everything all at once. But you never know when this knowledge will come in useful. So, if you want to improve your computer knowledge, you can start slow and add one more tool to your toolbox each time.

With that out the way, let's see some of the most used software programs in the workplace.

### Knowledge of Operating Systems and of Basic IT Troubleshooting

The first step to digital literacy is having a well-rounded understanding of operating systems.

There is no need to become an IT expert if that is not your goal, but instead, know their basic functionalities.

The [Operating System (OS for short)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-os-operating-system-definition-for-beginners/) manages all of the software and hardware on a computer and allows you to interact with the computer in the first place.

The three most widely used operating systems are:

- The Windows Operating System, which is owned by Microsoft.
- macOS, which is owned by Apple.
- Linux, which is an open-source operating system. In contrast to Windows and macOS, Linux is not proprietary software. No one company owns it. Anyone with the knowledge can contribute, make changes and improvements, and help maintain it.

In addition, it helps to have some at least basic IT troubleshooting skills. This knowledge will help you find solutions when you get stuck, and help you solve problems by yourself.

For example, some basic computer troubleshooting skills are:

- Recognizing network icons and knowing if the WiFi is on or off.
- Knowing what to do when a computer program has frozen.
- Knowing how to handle crashes.
- Knowing when and how to reboot the system.
- Knowing how to restart the computer or interact with Task Manager to handle unresponsive programs.
- Knowing what to do when the computer doesn't power up.
- Knowing how to solve issues with USB memory sticks and external hard drives.
- Knowing how to speed up a slow computer.
- Knowing how to perform basic network diagnostics.
- Knowing when to update system and when a routine maintenance is needed.
- knowing about user account management.

You'll use a GUI (Graphic User Interface) to make your way around a computer.

The different buttons and dropdown menus, the pointing and mouse clicks, and the different icons you see on your screen make GUIs easy to use.

However, there may be times when you will need to use a Command Line Interface (or CLI for short).

A CLI is a text-based program. You type commands in a prompt using keyboard navigation only and save significant time when performing repetitive tasks.

On Windows, the software program is called Command Prompt, and on macOS, it is called Terminal.

A shell (such as Bash or Zsh shell) is the interface between you, the user, and the computer's operating system.

You type commands in one of the CLI applications. The shell reads, processes, and interprets the commands and instructs the Operating System to perform the task.

Knowing your way around the command line will help you save considerable time. Some basic command line skills to have are:

- General system commands.
- How to create and delete files and folders.
- How to view contents of files and folders.
- How to open programs.
- How to use a command-line text editor, such as Vim, Emacs or Nano, to write to files.
- How to manage current working processes.

### Knowledge of Web Browsers and Web Searching Skills

- Safari, developed by Apple.

To use web browsers productively, here are some of the skills you need:

- Make sure you use modern and updated web browsers instead of older and unsupported ones.
- Know the navigational buttons. Go back to the previous page, refresh the current page, create a file and open the page in a new tab or window, and know your way around the browser's menu for extra functionalities, to name a few.
- Enter URLs (short for Uniform Resource Locator). URLs are a unique web address that you put into the browser's address bar.
- Know how to read a URL by understanding its different parts and recognizing when a website might be sketchy.
- Perform searches by using keywords and perform basic Internet research.
- Know how to apply filters for advanced searching techniques.
- Make use of tabbed browsing. With modern browsers, you can open, manage and switch between many web pages simultaneously – in the same browser window.
- Know how to restore tabs.
- Create and manage bookmarks with the browser's built-in bookmark manager. Bookmarks is another name for 'your favorites' – the websites you would like to save and keep for future reference. You can create folders and subfolders for a more organized bookmarking system.
- Know how to manage and delete browsing history on your system.
- Know about browser security and privacy issues. The first step is knowing the [difference between HTTP and HTTPS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-https-http-vs-https-meaning-and-how-it-works/), especially when making financial transactions across the internet. Next is using Incognito mode for protecting sensitive data when sharing a computer with someone else or using a public computer.
- Know how to clear browser cache and cookies to improve load time, save space, and reduce bandwidth.
- Know how to install extensions that have additional browser functionalities.

Know how to write basic SQL commands to perform CRUD (short for Create Read Update Delete) operations to query the database and manipulate the data stored.

## How to Include Computer Skills on Résumé

Below are some key points to consider when including computer skills on your résumé:

- You could create a separate dedicated section, such as a sidebar on the résumé, reserved for only listing your computer skills by including a list with bulleted points.
- Include computer skills that set you apart from other applicants and are only relevant to the position.  
    Just a note: don't list Microsoft Word as a computer skill if you are applying for a software developer role.  
    Microsoft Word may be a tool you use for your daily work, but employers assume you already have that knowledge, and it's not what they are interested in seeing from your résumé.
- List skills you have familiarity with and are comfortable using. Employers will probably ask questions based on the skills and technologies you added, so don't mislead and be direct about your exact level of proficiency.
- List relevant courses and diplomas/certifications you have taken to advance your skills.
- Do not list your skills accompanied by a metric bar with a percentage of how proficient you are.  
    For example, don't include 'I am 78% proficient in JavaScript'. Something like that could easily lead to confusion.
- Be specific. For example, don't just include 'Advanced knowledge in Microsoft Excel'. Instead, provide some examples of what you can do with Excel, such as naming the advanced functions and formulas you are proficient in.
- Instead of just only listing skills, focus on mentioning achievements, milestones, metrics, and how your computer skills helped a company. Employers are interested in seeing how your computer skills helped improve your team's productivity and increased sales and revenue in your previous jobs.  
    For example, you could mention a task you automated by writing a Python script which saved significant time for your team.
- Make sure to keep it brief and get your point across in a concise way. Recruiters and employers don't spend much time going through résumés, so relevant information needs to stand out easily and in a summarized way.
- You can include links to articles, a conference talk you gave, a workshop you hosted, or a YouTube channel you have, where you explain technical topics in your field. This way, you show to prospective employers that you are engaged in your community, and you have the knowledge and expertise they are looking for.

[Here's a guide to writing a résumé](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-developer-resume-recruiters-will-read/) that hiring managers will actually read.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, now you have a better understanding of what computer skills you should have if you're job hunting in today's market. We went over what you need to know to utilize software programs effectively, and how to present those skills clearly to employers.
