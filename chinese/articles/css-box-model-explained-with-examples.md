# Why learn CSS Box Model?

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/YT-Thumbnail.png)

The CSS box model comprises the **box-sizing, padding** and **margin** properties. If you **don't** use them, your website will look like this üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Page-1-1.png)

**website with no margin padding**

But if you use the box model properties correctly, your website will look like this üëá

**A website using Box Model properties**

Much more visually appealing, right? If you want to make your website with accurate calculations, like the one above üëÜ then this topic is for you. Learning about the CSS box model is one of many ways that will help you make **pixel perfect websites.**

This article will talk about how to use these properties:

-   Padding
-   Margin
-   Border
-   box-sizing

# How to Use CSS box-model Properties

Let's look at some examples of where we can use the properties of the CSS box-model. We're gonna dissect the website shown above. üëÜ

Let's have a closer look at the **navbar**. You can notice the difference between the example that uses the padding property and the one that doesn't:

**Navbar items using padding property**

Now let's have a closer look to the **content section along with the buttons**. Again, you'll notice the difference ‚Äì the right one is also using the **padding** property.

**content section using padding property**

# CSS Box-Model Diagram

Think of the CSS box-model like an **onion**. It has **4 Layers**:

-   **1st** layer: Content
-   **2nd** layer: Padding
-   **3rd** layer: Border
-   **4th** layer: Margin

### 1st box-model layer: Content

In HTML, **everything behaves like a box**. Let's insert some content with a kitty image. üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-1--1--1.png)

**1st Layer of Box-Model : Content**

### 2nd box-model layer: Padding

The next layer of the CSS box model is the **padding** layer. It wraps our content like this üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-2-2.png)

**2nd Layer of Box-Model : Padding**

### 3rd box-model layer: Border

The next layer of the CSS box model is the **border** layer. It wraps our content + padding like this üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-3--1-.png)

**Black dotted line is the Border**

### 4th box-model layer: Margin

The next and final layer of the CSS box model is the **margin** layer. It wraps our content + padding + border like this üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Margin.png)

**Grey Region is The Margin**

Alright, let's see how these properties work in a project.

# How to Setup the Project

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-8.png)

This tutorial is **good for everyone including beginners.** If you want to code along, then follow these steps.

### HTML

Open VS Code or [Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/) and write this code üëá inside the **body tag:**

```HTML
<div class="box-1"> Box-1 </div>
```

### CSS

Clear the default styles of our browser üëá

```CSS
* {
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

Now, let's style our box üëá

```CSS
.box-1 {
  width: 300px;
  background-color: skyblue;
  font-size: 50px;
}
```

We're all set, let's start coding! ‚ú®

# The Padding Property

But first, let's discuss the **practical uses** of the padding property. Then, we'll see how to use this property.

Generally, I use padding to put some space between contents. Look at this **navbar** üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-47-1.png)

**Navbar items using padding property**

Here's another example for you ‚Äì look at the below content, with two buttonsüëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-48-1.png)

**content section using padding property**

### How to use the padding property in CSS

This is the **shorthand** of the four padding properties:

-   padding-top
-   padding-right
-   padding-bottom
-   padding-left

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-10.png)

**Shorthand of padding property**

And remember, padding is the space you add on top of your **main content**:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Padding.png)

**2nd Layer of Box-Model : Padding**

Let's add some padding to our content. **The red colored area is the padding üëá**

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/bmnmmmmm.gif)

**Red colored area is the Padding**

In order to recreate the results above, ‚òù write this code in your CSS: üëá

```CSS
// Padding added on top, right, left, bottom of .box-1

.box-1{
   padding : 100px;
}
```

Let's open our developer console and **go to the computed section**:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/a.png)

**Computed CSS Box model** 

At the very middle is our **content** which is **300px** in width. Look around our content, we have added **100px padding** all around it.

Let's try adding padding to just 1 side of our content (only the right side):

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-11--1-.png)

**padding-right property**

In order to recreate the results above, ‚òù write this code in your CSS: üëá

```CSS
.box-1{
   padding: 0 100px 0 0;
}

// Or you can use üëá

.box-1{
   padding-right: 100px;
}
```

Now, open the computed section on your developer console üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/s.png)

**Computed CSS Box model** 

Look ‚Äì the padding of 100px has only been added on the **right** side of our content as we specified.

# The Border Property

You'll commonly use the border property **while making buttons**. Here's a GIF demo üëá

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/iUTNdCt5RVTXlD7ARq/giphy.gif)

**Buttons, using the border property**

Notice how a **white colored border** shows around the button when I hover the mouse over the button.

### How to use the border property in CSS

And remember, the **border** is the space added on top of our **main content + padding**: **üëá**

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Border.png)

**Black dotted line is the Border**

There are three crucial **inputs** of the border property:

-   border size
-   border style : **solid / dotted/ dashed**
-   border color

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-23.png)

**border property syntax**

There are three styles of border property as I listed above. In this example, we'll use the **dashed** style:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-22.png)

To recreate the results above, write this code in your CSS: üëá

```CSS
.box-1 {
  width: 300px;
  font-size: 50px;
  padding: 50px;
  border: 10px dashed black;
}
```

Let's open our console and see the box model calculations:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/dxcxcvbxc-1.png)

**computed CSS Box Model**

Now look at the above image‚òù ‚Äì a 10px border is added all around our **content + padding**.

# The Margin Property

Generally, I use the **margin** property to put some **whitespace** between my content and the main screen on the desktop layout (large screens). Look at this GIF: üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/rea.gif)

**Adding margin to a website**

Notice that I'm adding the margin to the left and right edges of my website above üëÜ

Here's another sample GIF of **a use case** of the margin property: üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/reammmmm.gif)

**Adding margin to website**

### How to use margin property in CSS

This is the **shorthand** for the four properties of the margin property:

-   margin-top
-   margin-right
-   margin-bottom
-   margin-left

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-12.png)

**Shorthand of margin property**

And remember, **margin** is the space added on top of our **main content + padding + border**:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Margin-1.png)

**Grey Region is The Margin**

Let's add a margin to our content. **The content is getting pushed due to the Margin** in this GIF:**üëá**

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/agid.gif)

**Content is getting pushed due to margin**

To recreate the results above, write this code in your CSS: üëá

```CSS
.box-1 {
  padding: 50px;
  border: 10px dashed black;
  
  margin: 50px;
}
```

We can check the calculations again: üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/klkjkj.png)

**computed CSS Box Model**

Look, a 50px margin has been added all around our **content + padding + border**.

Let's try adding a **margin** to just 1 side of our content (only the left side):

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-22--2-.png)

**margin-left property**

To recreate the results above, write this code in your CSS üëá

```CSS
.box-1 {
  padding: 50px;
  border: 10px dashed black;
  
  margin-left: 50px;
}
```

On the console, we can see that a **50px margin** got applied only on the **left side** üëá

# Take a Break !

So far so good ‚Äì take a break! You deserve it üíñ

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-24--1-.png)

# The Box-sizing Property

This property defines how our margin, padding, and borders will be calculated. There are three types of calculations (you can call them values):

-   border-box
-   padding-box
-   content box

### Note

We're not gonna discus **box-sizing: padding-box,** as only Firefox supports it and it isn't used very often.

# What is the difference between content-box and border-box in CSS?

Both border-box and content-box work in the same way. Look at these images:üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-15.png)

**Boxes using border-box value**

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-17.png)

**Boxes using content-box value**

So, what's the main difference here? The difference is noticeable when we are adding margin, border, or padding to our boxes.

When we are using the **box-sizing: content-box**, which is the default value, it will **add** a margin, padding, and borders **outside the box**, like this: üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/abcdefg.gif)

**padding, getting applied outside the box**

You can see the calculations here as well: üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Frame-19.png)

**Calculations with content-box**

Which means that things can get out of control and you'll see unexpected calculations. This means that it's **hard to make responsive websites.** Always use the **box-sizing: border-box** property instead.

But when we are using the **box-sizing: border-box** property, it will **add** a margin, padding, and borders **inside the box**, like this:üëá

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/c-box.gif)

**padding, getting applied inside the box**

The **box-sizing: border-box** property shows us the **EXACT** calculations of our HTML elements, which means that this value is **ideal for making responsive websites.**

You can experiment with the values as well ‚Äì just follow along with this code: üëá

```CSS
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Or, Write üëá */

* {
  box-sizing: content-box;
}
```

# Conclusion

Congratulations! You can now make **pixel perfect websites.** Not only that, but when you're coding, you can figure out why your content is behaving strangely.
