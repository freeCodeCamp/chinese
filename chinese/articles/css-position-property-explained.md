If you want to make **stunning websites that looks artistic, unique, and beautiful,** then you should definitely learn how to use the CSS position property. Let's see how it works.

Using **Flexbox or Grid**, you can make a **symmetrical website** like this: 👇

**Website made w/ Flexbox**

With the **position property**, you can make an **asymmetrical website** like this:👇

**Website made w/ Grid & position properties**

You can't place your content anywhere you wish using Flexbox and Grid. You're limited around the **X and Y Axis**. Look at this drawing to see what I mean: 👇

**Symmetrical content layout showing elements placed respective to the x and y axis**

Your boxes will follow these exact measurements. 👆

But, using the **position property**, you can place your content anywhere you wish by **detaching** each element from the other elements.

**Asymmetrical content layout showing elements placed irrespective of x and y axis.**

You can place your boxes **anywhere** you wish with this sort of layout. 👆 In other words, you will have **free movement** around your screen.

Here's another example of what you can make using the position property:

**An Asymmetrical Website**

You can place or move those little dots and waves patterns and donut image all around the page **☝** anywhere you wish using the position property.

# Project Setup

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/Frame-4--7-.png)

For this project, you can use any code editor that has the **emmet plugin** installed. I'm gonna use [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io).

### HTML

Inside the body tag, write this code: 👇

```HTML
<div class="box-1"> </div>
```

### CSS

Clear your default browser settings and add this CSS:👇

```CSS
*{
   margin: 0px;
   padding: 0px;
   box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Style the box-1 class like this:👇

```CSS
.box-1{
   width: 120px;
   height: 120px;
   background-color: skyblue;
   border: 2px solid black;
}
```

Our position property has 5 values:

1.  relative
2.  absolute
3.  static
4.  fixed
5.  sticky

To move our box, we'll use 4 properties:

-   **Top, Bottom**
-   **Left, Right**

# What is the Static Position in CSS?

This has **no use cases**. This is the **default value** of every element.

Default position of every element

# What are the Relative and Absolute Positions in CSS?

Both the **relative position** and **absolute position** work in the same way except in one field. We use `relative` to identify the parent class. And we use `absolute` to identify the children classes.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/Frame-11--2-.png)

**Position VS relative position**

### Let's look at 2 examples 👇

First, let's experiment with the **`relative`** value. Try out this code:

```CSS
.box-1{
/* Other codes are here*/

   position: relative;
   left: 100px;
}
```

This is the result you'll get:👇

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/Frame-13--1-.png)

We can duplicate the same result using the **`absolute`** value like this: 👇

```CSS
.box-1{
/* Other codes are here*/

   position: absolute;
   left: 100px;
}
```

Let's investigate the main difference between **relative and absolute** positions.

### Relative vs Absolute Position in CSS

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/BEM-1--1-.png)

### HTML

Write this code inside your HTML: 👇

```HTML
<body>
   <div class="box-1">
    
       <div class="box-2"> </div>	
        
   </div>
</body>
```

### CSS

Style the boxes with the following CSS:👇

```CSS
.box-1{
	width: 300px;
	height: 300px;
	background-color: skyblue;
	border: 2px solid black;
    margin: auto;
}

.box-2{
	width: 100px;
	height:100px;
	background-color: pink;
	border: 2px solid black;
}
```

It should look like this:👇

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/dd-2.png)

**The result is a blue box with a smaller pink box in the upper left**

Now, we'll select our classes like this: 👇

```CSS
body{ }

.box-1{ }

.box-2{ }
```

Now, write this code in your CSS: 👇

```CSS
body{
	
}

.box-1{
/* This is the  👇 parent */
	position: relative;
}
.box-2{
/* This is the  👇 child */
	position: absolute;
	left: 100px;
}
```

Here's the result: 👇

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/Frame-14.png)

**The result is that the pink box has moved right 100px**

Notice that .box-2 has moved **100px** from .box-1.

This is because .box-1 is the **parent** and .box-2 is the **child**.

Let's change it again. Write this code in your CSS:

```CSS
body{
/* This is the  👇 parent */
   position: relative;	
}

.box-1{

}
.box-2{
/* This is the  👇 child */
   position: absolute;
    left: 100px;
}
```

Now here's the result: 👇

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/Frame-15.png)

**The result is that the pink box has moved 100px from the body**

Notice that .box-2 has moved **100px** from the **body** element.

This is because the **body** is the **parent** and .box-2 is the **child**.

# What is the Fixed Position in CSS?

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/Frame-16--1-.png)

This value will **fix the position** of your element on the screen even when you **scroll** in the browser. Let's look at some examples to see how it works.

### Fixed position example

Write this code in your HTML. 👇 Once you write `lorem200`, make sure to hit the **Tab** key on your keyboard:

```HTML
<div class="container">
	
	<p>lorem200</p>
    
	<div class="box-1"> fixed </div>
    
	<p>lorem200</p>		

</div>
```

And here's the CSS:

```CSS
.container{
	height: 3000px;
}

.box-1{
	height: 120px;
	width: 120px;
	background-color: skyblue;
	border: 2px solid black;
	
	display: grid;
	place-content: center;
}
```

Then add this CSS at the bottom:

```CSS
.box-1{

	position: fixed;
	top: 100px;
	left: 200px;
}
```

Here's the result:👇

You can see that the element remains fixed even when we scroll our browser.

# What is the Sticky Position in CSS?

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/06/Frame-17.png)

After scrolling to a certain point on our screen, this value will **fix the position** of our element on the screen so it doesn't move.

### Sticky position example

Don't change anything in your current HTML and CSS except this one value:

```CSS
.box-1{
/*  Play with  👇 this value */
   position: sticky;
   top: 30px;
   left: 200px;
}
```

Here's the result: 👇

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/175hkevbKC3yUfiLQc/giphy.gif)

You can see that after a **certain scroll point**, the element remains fixed at the exact top of our browser screen.
