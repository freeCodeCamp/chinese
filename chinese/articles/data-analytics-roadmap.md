So if you're not a math prodigy or a computer whiz, don't worry. Statistics, computer science, and business are just a few of the numerous disciplines that are incorporated into the multidisciplinary topic of data analysis. Everyone who enjoys learning, solving problems, and making a difference can really enjoy it.

So how can you find out more about what a data analyst does? You can start by looking through the numerous free resources that are accessible online. For example, [here an article that discusses what data analysts actually do](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-does-a-data-analyst-do-data-analyst-job-description/). And [here's one that discusses data analyst vs data science roles](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/data-analyst-vs-data-scientist-whats-the-difference/).

Many blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels offer entertaining and informative content on the subject of data analysis. I will be dropping some YouTube channels that have helped me over the years below.

To gain a feel of the skills and qualities needed, you can also network with other data analysts, go to meetings or seminars, and study job descriptions.

Don't forget to consider whether dealing with data is something you enjoy. Do you enjoy finding patterns and solving puzzles? Do you want to change the world for the better? Data analysis may be the ideal career choice for you if the answer is yes.

The first step in your path is to understand what a data analyst does. Enjoy yourself, take your time, and don't be hesitant to ask questions.

## Step 2: Explore Job Requirements for Data Analyst Roles

Now that you have a better understanding of the role of a data analyst, it's time to start looking at what employers are looking for. After all, you want to make sure that your skills and knowledge match up with what's required in the job market.

But before you start panicking about not having enough experience, remember that every company is different. Some may prioritize programming skills, while others may value communication and business acumen. That's why it's important to do your research and find out what specific skills and qualifications are most in demand in your desired industry or company.

So how do you go about finding this information? Well, one great place to start is by checking out job listings and descriptions on job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, or Glassdoor. This can give you a good sense of the key requirements and qualifications for different data analyst roles.

## Step 3: Get Comfortable with Math and Statistics

Okay, I know what you're thinking. Math and statistics? Yikes!

![im-out-gif-11-1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/03/im-out-gif-11-1.gif)

But hear me out before you run for the hills. For a data analyst to be able to make sense of data and derive valuable insights from it, having a fundamental understanding of these concepts is essential.

So what fundamental statistical concepts and formulas should you be familiar with?

Now, to start, there are measures of central tendency known as mean, median, and mode, which can give you an idea of the typical value in a dataset. You should know how to calculate them.

The standard deviation is a measure of how widely distributed the data are from the average, and you should be able to calculate it.

And in order to find relationships between variables and generate predictions based on those associations, you should also be familiar with correlation and regression.

But it's not just about numbers. You'll also need a rudimentary understanding of linear algebra, which is employed in many data analysis approaches. [Here's an in-depth course (and textbook)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/linear-algebra-full-course/) to get you started.

You may need to employ matrices to modify and manipulate data, or you may need to use [linear regression](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/data-science-with-python-8-ways-to-do-linear-regression-and-measure-their-speed-b5577d75f8b/) to forecast future values based on historical trends.

If you don't have a solid math background, this may seem difficult. But don't be concerned! There are numerous resources available to assist you in your learning.

For example, Khan Academy offers lessons and practice tasks in math and statistics. If you prefer books, "Data Science for Beginners" by Andrew Park is an excellent resource that covers both statistical and mathematical principles in an accessible manner.

freeCodeCamp is developing a math curriculum [which you can read about here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-foundational-math-curriculum/).

And [here's a guide on the statistics you need to know](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/statistics-for-data-science/) to get into data science and pursue fields like Machine Learning.

The key is to start small and build up your knowledge gradually. Don't be afraid to ask questions or seek help when you need it. With a little practice and persistence, you'll soon find that math and statistics are actually kind of fun (no, seriously!).

## Step 6: Learn Python for Data Analysis

I know there's a lot of speculation as to whether or not a data analyst needs Python – some say they do while some say they don't.

For me, I'd like to say it depends on the company you're working for – but it's nice to have an edge by learning Python as it's one of the most widely used programming languages in the world of data analysis. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, making it a popular choice for data analysts.

Python has a [vast array of libraries and tools](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-data-science-course-matplotlib-pandas-numpy/) that can make data analysis easier, such as Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, NumPy for scientific computing, and Matplotlib for data visualization. It also has the [ability to automate tasks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-automation-scripts/), making data analysis more efficient and effective.

[Learning Python for data analysis](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-data-analysis-with-python-course/) is a great investment in your career as a data analyst. Not only will it allow you to work with powerful libraries, but it will also open up many opportunities to work with larger datasets and more complex analyses.

There are many resources available to help you learn Python, from free online courses to paid online programs and textbooks. Some resources include [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp), DataCamp, [CodeBasis](https://www.youtube.com/@codebasics), [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh) and [Microsoft Learn.](https://learn.microsoft.com?wt.mc_id=studentamb_207021)

By learning Python, you'll be able to perform more complex data analysis, automate tasks, and work with a broader range of datasets, making you a valuable asset in any data-focused organization.

## Step 7: Master a Data Visualization Tool

As a data analyst, it's essential to be able to communicate your findings in a clear and concise manner. One way to do this is through data visualization.
