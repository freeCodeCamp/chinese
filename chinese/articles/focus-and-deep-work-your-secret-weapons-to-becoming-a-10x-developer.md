**换句话说，就是怎样才能成为互联网大厂公司程序员中的一员。**

不管你是一个正在忙着工作的职员，还是一个想要得到他人关注和技能提升的初级程序员；不管你是一个正打算变换路线，从公司离职去创业或者从事其他事情的领导者，还是一个刚毕业的没工作的大学生。这都没关系！

只要你是一个程序员，没有什么技能比专注和钻研对你的成功更重要。

作者Cal Newport 的 《 Deep Work 》中写到:

> **“The Deep Work 假设：**执行深度工作的能力正变得越来越罕见，同时，它对我们的经济生活也越来越重要。...少部分拥有这种技能的人，在工作和生活中使用它，将会受益无穷。”

对于成为一个成功的，被市场需求的开发者，我将使用一些《Deep Work》的观点并结合我自己的思想。如果你是一个在任何技术领域的人，我强烈建议您阅读它。

### 从恐惧代码到技术负责人。
编程，我是自学成才。但是，我是20岁才开始编程的。我一直觉得自己是一个最终能进入创造性领域的艺术家。

我做到了。大学毕业后，我 创办了一家为小型本地企业提供图像和网页设计的公司。我是 Photoshop 的专家，并且知道 HTML 和 CSS 是危险的。

更恼火的是，只要写一行 PHP（一种程序语言） ，我就得外包出去。

我被代码吓到了很长一段时间，在那期间，我都不碰它，都把相应的工作交给有计算机科学学位的人。

“敲错一个代码，客户的业务将会不能运行...”，我觉得。老实说，我不太靠谱（在没有版本控制之前，FTP都不能回退代码的）。

现在我是一家财富50强的公司的技术负责人，所开发的是一个每月有数百万用户的产品。

我是怎样在短短几年内到这的呢？🤔

我的“秘诀”就是专注和深入工作。没什么特别的。我花时间锻炼自己怎样长时间专注于一件特定的事情，不分心。

### 代码是一种艺术。

编程是一种创造性的追求。

对普通人来说，它是技术且枯燥的，但你是一个创造者。你正在创造世界上没有的东西。所谓“没有”，就是你脑海中对于应用程序的一个想法，又或者是产品经理的功能需求。

它不存在，但你要创造它。不是用绘画也不是用文字，而是用代码（好吧，有文字，只要不是保留字）。

如果你有一些想法，但要高水准的实现，那么，你就必须练习。

当你能更好的专注于某件事很长一段时间，输出的数量和质量都会提升。

艺术，音乐和写作都需要很长一段连续的时间。科普一下，在此期间，脑细胞之间的突触上的髓鞘变稠。编程也不例外。

你会在练习和掌控时间上越来越好。当你的练习越有效时，你可以在更短的时间内，获得更好的成绩。

是的。你能成为那个10倍高效的开发者（5倍，2倍还要1倍，也很棒）。我说明一下，我讨厌这种流行语 “摇滚明星”、“忍者”、“10倍开发者”。每一个开发人员都是的，但是公司和招聘人员很喜欢这样称呼。

尽管俗气，但是在 “10倍开发者” 理念背后还是有很多真理的。

它不是说一个人可以代替十个人，而是说一些开发者能在更少的时间更高质量的完成更多的事情。他们始终如一的做到了这一点，并不是比任何一个人更努力。

这种能力不是与生俱来。也不是你可以 “打开” 的东西。它是一种可以，而且必须练习和训练的技能。

我在招聘方面工作了几十次，我会告诉你公司都想拥有一个由10倍开发者组成的团队。但是，那是不现实的。

应该提供更多开放的开发者工作机会，而不是找合格的开发者去填补公司的职位。公司连一般的合格的开发者都很难找到，更别说找（多少）倍开发者了。

“Senior executives believe that the lack of quality developer talent is one of the biggest potential threats to their growth.” - The Developer Coefficient
It’s hard to find good talent.

Most companies will knock down the door for a 10x developer but they’re happy hiring 5x, 2x, and even 1x developers.

A 1x developer (yes, I made this up) is a developer who can do the job they’re hired to do. Nothing more, nothing less. Seriously. Any company will be delighted with that. Plenty has been written about the astronomical cost of a bad hire.

The 2 Steps You Need to Multiply Your Programming Skills with Focus and Deep Work
It’s time to step up your career. There’s so much opportunity for you to get hired and thrive in a career you love.

If you’re the entrepreneurial type, the same lessons apply. More so because your livelihood depends on being effective with your time.

This is how you go from junior to senior developer. This is how you go from 0.5x developer to 5x developer. This is how you get your side project off the ground when you only have a 10 hours a week to work on it.

Hell, this is how you survive.

“To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances.”
— Deep Work p.13
Learning to Focus is HARD.
The first thing to realize is that learning to focus isn’t easy. You’re not going to be able to start producing novels of quality code from the start. Especially if you’ve never dealt with the reality of how easily distracted you are.

Learning to focus requires practice. Anything that requires practice means its difficult. If it wasn’t, you’d be good at it by default.

You’re going to struggle and that’s OK. We’ll start small.

Don’t Confuse Busyness with Productivity.
Deep work is not locking yourself in a dark room and forcing yourself to aimlessly navigate code for 14 hours at a time. Just because you’re doing something doesn’t mean it’s worth doing.

You need to figure out what’s important and what’s not. That’s beyond the scope of this post. If you’re going to spend the time learning how to focus, then do it on something that has a high return for the effort involved.

It’s like the sun and a magnifying glass.

Distracted work is your energy going in every direction like the sun. You can stand outside in the sun and you’re not going to get hurt.

Learn to concentrate that scattered energy with a magnifying glass and your ability to destroy goes from 0 to 10. We want to preserve that limited power for important things (the sun goes down eventually).

Step 1 — Removing Distraction
Multitasking is a lie. You’re fooling yourself if you think you can write quality code while checking Slack messages or reading news in another window.

We live in a world of distraction. The technology we work on is a double-edged sword. There’s nothing like that sweet, sweet dopamine hit from a new notification.

“Cool, someone liked that I saw Hamilton.” But that’s poison to your ability to focus.

Removing distraction is the foundation of focused, deep work.

Put your phone on silent or turn it off if you’re not in a position that has to be on-call. I use the Forest app to prevent me from going on my phone. Face down, somewhere out of arm’s reach is good too.
Close Slack. This is a huge one for me because I have this OCD where I need to clear my queue of unread messages. Most of these messages are noise so its better for me to close Slack when working.
Close any other apps that are going to distract you with notifications, like Outlook.
This is the hardest one of all — close any browser windows not relevant to your task. Now block all your favorite websites. I love the HeyFocus app ($20) but there are a bunch of free extensions out there.
Headphones on — This keeps people from bothering you (hopefully), but also listening to the same album over and over is a great focusing tool. It might be a priming thing (signaling to your brain that its time to work) or a flow thing (the music puts you in a good mood). Either way, a lot of developers swear by this technique.
Step 2 — Pomodoro Technique (The Secret Weapon)

“A Hefty Bowl of Productivity” by Roychan Kruawan on Unsplash
Before you have a panic attack thinking that you can’t go 8 hours without any distractions, don’t worry. We’ll be using the Pomodoro Technique to break up our day.

There are a lot of productivity techniques out there, but my favorite has been the Pomodoro. I’m going to paraphrase it below to get you started.

If you want the official rundown, check out The Pomodoro Technique book, which gets more detailed and rule-oriented.

Work for a 25 Minute Block (a Pomodoro)
You’ll work for 25 minutes, undistracted, on one thing. That chunk of work is a one “Pomodoro.”

Use a Timer. I’ve used an old school hourglass before. If you want to be a true Pomodoro aficionado, then use a tomato timer.

Then Take a 5 Minute Break
It is imperative that you walk away when its break time. Grab some water. Browse Hacker News. Go to the bathroom. Whatever it is, work is over. Disconnect from work completely.

One Task Only in a Pomodoro
This can be fixing a bug, planning out a new feature, or starting a video series to learn a new framework.

If the task is too big (like “make an app”) then you have to break it down into smaller chunks that take roughly 25 minutes.

Some tasks need several Pomodoros to complete. It might take three Pomodoros to code a feature and two more to write the tests.

Or you might need to batch similar, small tasks into a Pomodoro (ex — reply on 5 JIRA tickets).

The point is that the task, or tasks, have to be one “type” of work.

As an aside, the main reason we procrastinate is because we get overwhelmed by huge, insurmountable tasks. If your goal is to “Write a Book” you’ll never do it. When you break it out into smaller chunks like “Write an outline” or “Write 300 words” then the path becomes clearer. Starting is easier, and doable.

While this post has been about becoming a better developer, not procrastination, the truth is that many times they are the same thing.

Work Without Distraction
See Step 1. If you get distracted, the Pomodoro doesn’t count and you have to start over.

Work Your Way Up to 25 Minutes
25 minutes might be hard for you if you’ve never done this before. Start with 10 minutes and work your way up from there. Next one would be 15, then 20, then 25.

You can work your way up to 55-minute blocks when you really get good at this.

Work Your Way Up to Multiple Pomodoros Per Day
The first time you try distraction-free work, 25 minutes in a day might be all you can handle. That’s fine. Keep working your way up by adding a little each day.

How Does This Make Me a Better Developer?
Let’s be real. You’re not helping your career by jumping from your code editor to a chatroom to an email to a real-life conversation.

You might look and feel busy, and you might even ship some code once in a while.

But the fact is that a few hours of undistracted, deep work produces more quantity and quality than a full day of scattered, distracted work.

Start with one Pomodoro. Eventually you’ll be able to chain a few Pomodoros together.

Then you’ll chain a few days of Pomodoros together.

Then weeks and months.

You’ll find its easier to get into a flow state, and it will happen more often.

This is gold. This is when you have those “eureka” moments and breakthroughs.

This is when the hard thing that’s been kicking your ass becomes easy.

This is when your coding skills level up exponentially.

The demand for good, qualified programmers is higher than ever. The surest path to success is getting into the ritual of deep, focused work.
