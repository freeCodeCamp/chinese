开发者走自由职业路线已成普遍。对很多在freeCodeCamp刚刚完成学习的人来说便是如此，他们并不想“为别人打工”，而是想为自己打拼。不仅如此，很多在职的开发者也都在想着单干。

同样受自由职业路线吸引的还有那些虽然已有一份开发工作但是想额外赚点外快的一群人。

但无论出自何种原因，重要的是，如果你想建立自己的小事业，你要能够走对自己的每一步。走上正确的道路，你才能成为上面这张图片中的人。

而一旦走上了错误的道路，你就会成为下面这张图片中的人。

## 自由职业开发者赚取收入的3条核心法则 ([返回顶部][7])

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nM4-ArtOzEsqoFCqbTRIP1H-24V27fF0n6Fk1cEzDk0tRePuoep_f9KwpIyHp-aEP5bTQuECJvKRJaEBUkiCz0ICm37KHy7xweTThdTMpk-Cnin0dUNGEgD82k6zHQb0yWiJ35gK)

自由职业开发者要想赚取收入，首先要对普通意义上的赚钱过程有一个认识。如果连基础的问题都还没搞清楚就贸然想要捞一笔，那就会想玩大富翁一样，你的对手个个老奸巨猾，可你连基本的游戏规则都还糊里糊涂、一窍不通。

想要赚钱有3条法则：

-   你要明白，你赚到的钱的多少是直接和你为他人提供的价值大小挂钩的。
-   你要明白，要想赚钱，就要把时间花在高价值的事情上。
-   你要明白，当你开始单干的那一刻，你就已然投身一份全职工作之中，无论你是否已有客户。

让我们一个一个来看。

### 开发者一定要认识到，要想赚钱就以为着你要为他人提供价值

很多初次投身创业的人在传统的工作中已经待习惯了。这种传统是指，你的报酬是以你的工作时间来衡量的。好比说，如果你获得了一份时薪为X的工作，那么无论你在这一小时里做了多少有价值的事情你都会得到X的报酬。

但是，当你为你的客户提供开发服务时，他们更关心的是你的服务中为他们创造了多少价值。举个例子来说，假如你要为一家小公司制作一个网站或是开发一款App，决定这家公司愿意支付你多少酬劳的是他们预期在未来能够从这一网站或是App中获取的价值高低。

客户不会再想时薪制的工作那样基于你的工作时间投入来支付你酬金。取而代之的是，依据你的客户在未来因你的服务而会获得的价值增长。

说白了，就是你要明白，要想赚钱，你的服务就要能为客户提供价值，而无关你投入时间的多少。

另外很重要的一点是，有没有价值和价值的多少永远不是你说了算，而是客户说了算。太多情况下，开发者自己觉得基于某一种框架搭建的网站要“优”于基于另一种框架搭建但外观和功能大差不差的网站。

然而需要尤为强调的是，如果这两种设计都能很好地满足客户的需求，那么哪一种成本低，哪种就能为客户提供最大化的价值。

试着这么去想，假如一个客户在花费$2,500的情况下就能获得一个利用CMS建立的网站。而你却提议用Bootstrap去建立这样一个网站，但是价格为$3,500。你可能会觉得你的方案会更优，因为你用的是“实码”而不是诸如WordPress或是Joomla之类的CMS。

但是，等到你们都完成设计的那天，你们的网站在视觉上看起来没什么两样，两个对于吸引生意来说几乎不分上下。这种情况下，你所认为的“更优”的方案就并不能为客户带来更高的价值，因为它成本更高。显然，客户也不会选择这样一种方案。

想要赚钱？那就开始想像你怎么才能创造出客户心中所理解的价值。

### 开发者一定要明白，要想赚钱，就要把时间投入高价值的事情中去

看了这个小标题，你可能会发出“咄”的一声，但你后面越读就会越吃惊。我见到过很多很多很多很多很多小公司或是小经营把时间花费在根本就“无伤大雅”的事情上。

试着这么去想。很多小经营能通过从事X活动来获取可观的收入。接着，他们就想要不再新开辟一种服务Y来壮大一下自己的生意。如果服务Y经营不利，他们就会又想去着眼于服务Z。

遗憾的是，这种策略是有点荒谬的。如果活动X能够赚钱，那就不要再把资源浪费到别的活动了，把X做大做强就够了。换句话说，挑选出你最能创造价值的活动，把它做大做强！这也是为什么马克·库班会说那句名言，“傻子才会搞多元化。”

让我们来看两个例子吧。

设想你的客户是小型企业，你能为它们建立一种相对简单、只具有某些功能的网站，为此你收取$3,000的服务费用。创建一个这样的网站你需要花费20个小时（也就是说，你每小时可以赚到150美元）。

但现在，设想你有能力去设计一种更大规模的电子商务产品，每卖一个就能赚$7,500到$10,000。但是，这样，你每小时的投入就只能获得$130的报酬，因为这个项目要更加复杂一些。

纵观两个项目，你很容易会去想第二个项目会更赚钱。但别忘了，第一个项目的单位投入报酬要更高。也就是说，你应该关注的是如何从那个$3,000的项目中赚更多钱，并把它设置为你的主营业务。

简单来说，你要明确哪些项目是你进行单位投入后能获利最多的，然后  **只去**  专注这些项目尽可能地把它们做大做强就行了。

### 作为自由职业开发者，你一定要明白，你在做一份全职工作

我曾与很多初创企业老板和创业者聊过，其中很多人都没有认识到自己在单干的那一刻起就开启了一份全职工作。哪怕是你连一个客户也没有，你在做的也是一份全职工作。我强烈强烈强烈强烈认为，很多小公司倒闭的主要原因中有一点就是他们没有认识到这一点。

让我来给你解释解释为什么说你是在做一份全职工作。

假如有一个叫Joe的开发者刚刚创立了它的自由职业开发业务。他搭建了一个网站，用以宣传推广他的服务，或许还花了点钱做了一些广告营销。后来它时不时地接了一些散客。他每次都能按时完成客户交付的项目，但除此之外对壮大自己的业务从未考虑更多。可能一年下来，他会每周花上20个小时开展自己的经营。

到了年底，Joe不禁感概，为什么自己的生意还是停留在初级阶段。然后，心想手机接到的订单越来越少，自己的广告营销也不是很有用，Joe就关掉了自己的经营，还心想是自己的营销问题导致自己经营失败。

但是，Joe没有认识到的是，打他开始经营的那天起，他就开启了一份全职工作。他之所以会失败，是因为它只是把经营当成了自己每周20个小时的副业。

其实道理很简单。天下没有免费的午餐，没有工作，就没有收入。这点对创业者同样适用。当你开始自己的经营时，就当自己是在做一份全职工作，每周投入不少于40个小时的时间进去。

也就是说，如果说你每周的编程和日常管理花费只需20个小时，那你就  **需要**  把剩余的时间用到去拓展新生意上。所以如果Joe每周用20个小时编程，就应该把另外20个小时用到拓展自己的人际关系网或是其它营销活动上去。倘若他花了这些时间，他的生意也会越来越多。

当你开始自己的经营时，记住这条简单的法则。你现在在做的事全职工作。只要你除了要编程还有别的空余时间，你就一定要  **尽最大可能**  利用剩余的时间去招揽更多的生意。

你想获得成功吗？如果你的回答是肯定的，那就好办了。记得，你一定要为你的客户提供价值，要专注于那些能够创造价值的事情，即那些能够在单位投入内产出最多报酬的事情。最后，要为你的生意投入足够的时间。这三点对于任何新生意来说都是盈利的核心法则。

## 为你的自由职业发展新事业谋篇布局 ([返回顶部][8])

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/q1K1mJB27zEZMakll6c_6DtYztQHjjGoVvFqsT36awdAT6e9A--adWBMCnwnOua-a1ojRMbzZUrkUB_hct3XpE1UyE7KtXrb6LpJ5Ue5eO5nJMjm4g7DjFozNK94WWaAX5yFGFBh)

当你决定好要开工时，为你的生意谋篇布局是下一步行动的重中之重。做好计划真得真得真得非常非常重要。很多创业者脑袋一热就开业了，开展的经营活动毫无章法，但却希望能够从中捞上一笔。

我这么说没有什么恶意，只是开办生意前没有计划就好比跳进你的车里漫无目的的四处乱逛一样，然后当你最后发现自己并没有到达想去的地点时又会觉得惊愕不已。

既然如此，那我们就看看在为你的新生意“准备”阶段你都需要什么吧。

要想让你的新生意落地，需要好几个步骤。我们一个一个来看吧，它们有：

-   为你的经营筹集资金。
-   确定你的服务领域。
-   确定你的服务项目和服务费用。
-   确定你的经营架构。

让我们一探究竟。

### 自由职业开发者需要为自己的新经营筹集资金

看到这个小标题，你可能会心想，“就这还要筹集资金？”这也不难理解，因为在大多人心中，一台笔记本电脑对于自由职业就够够的了。

嗯……不对。你的新经营会牵涉到很多花费，尤其是如果你想要……你懂的……大赚一笔。这些花费可能包括服务器空间租用费，经营负债保险费，专家咨询费（如律师、会计咨询费用），甚至更多。

但好消息是，在今天开办一家经营你并不需要花费太多。尤其是当你开始盈利时，你最初花的这点钱相比之下简直就是九牛一毛。铺垫了这么多，一起来看看为你的初始运营筹集资金时需要注意的几个原则吧。

原则一，处理财务时永远记得，和很多科技领域生意人的想法恰恰相反  _亏损是一项大忌！_  这一点在  [利润为先][9]这本书里讲得非常清楚和透彻，我强烈建议各位去读一读。

很多小公司为了谋求更快的增长不惜亏损营业，这真的是非常糟糕的想法。

说它糟糕的原因很多很长，在我的另一篇文章里有详细论述。援引那篇文章中最重要的一点就是，你应该在第一天以及此后的每个月中获利。

要想确保一开始就盈利并保持下去，最简单的方法是，如果你是只身一人在单干，记得防止出现任何债务。

遗憾的是，有太多人开办公司后（不仅是在编程领域），会用信用卡支付他们的初始支出，可能还会通过个人贷款来站稳脚跟。

而要确保你从第一天就是盈利的并如此保持下去其实很简单，只要你防止出现债务就够了。我为什么要这么说？因为如果你要杜绝一切债务，你就只能在你盈利的范围内去支出。也就是说，就算是在最坏的情况下，你也不过是不赚不陪。

然后，通过对利润进行重新投资，你的经营就会日渐壮大。当你赚到钱时，把钱投回你的生意中去，从而实现生意的壮大。经营壮大了以后，你的利润会更高。如此循环往复，你就会发现，即便在没有任何债务的情况下，你的生意仍能非常良好地维持运转。

### 自由职业开发者必须确定好自己的服务领域

这条值得说的不多。首先，我将为大家解释一下为什么你最一开始需要确定下来某一个“客户群体”。其次，我会说明如何去做出选择。

聚焦某一个具体的服务群体，不要想着“只要上门，我就服务”，这样你才能获得更高的利润并把生意做得更大。这点我在后面会具体解释。很多人会觉得挑选出一个合适的领域会很难，但其实并非如此。我们不妨就此讨论一番。

当你开始经营自己的生意时，  **非常重要的是，**  你要专注于某几个具体类别的客户，不要想着去当一个“万金油”式的程序员，各种活儿都想着往自己手里揽。

其背后的原因也很简单：如果你一直忙着构建各种不同类型的产品，那你就会陷入这样一种境地。你要不断学习新的框架，熟悉各式各样的第三方应用，因为只要客户要求将其融合入产品之中，你就得照做。

虽然说我也明白，学习新的知识总是有趣的（我喜欢自称是一个活到老学到老的人），但那  **绝不是**  经营生意的方式。

原因也很简单，规模。如果你专注为某一个特殊类别的公司做产品，你就一定需要针对每一个客户去学习一些必要的新知识，但这种学习是合理适度的。这就意味着最后你的收益会越来越多。我再来详细解释一下。

我的主营业务倾向于专注为法律公司制作和维护网站，并为其开发App用以帮助他们的律师工作起来更加顺畅。

鉴于很多法律公司的需求都很相似，我基本上可以对一个代码库进行重复利用。但是我在提供开发服务时是统一收费的，那么就意味着我在收取相应费用时虽然是收的完整费用，但我并非总是需要从零开始做一个产品。

可是相比之下，如果我的服务项目没有变，但是现在是为各行各业的公司提供服务，我就没有办法再去重复使用我已经写好的编程了。问问自己想要增加自己的利润吗？如果答案是肯定的，那就确定好一个服务领域后专注下去。

在选择服务领域时还需要注意的是，你最后确定提供的服务对你的客户来说过于过于过于过于高阶。因为我在专注为服务某一小类公司这方面已经经验很丰富了，我能预测出客户的需求，并为他们提供他们自己都没有考虑到的解决方案。

此外，因为我并非总是完全从零开始创建一个新的编码库的，我的客户也无需为各种bug过于担心。换句话说，专注于某一个具体的服务群体后，我能够为客户提供更好的产品、更佳的服务。

遗憾的是，很多刚刚创业的开发者都是“只要进门，我就服务”。这在长期来看对他们的盈利有着十分不利的影响。我刚刚已经解释了为什么专注一个领域能够增加利润。当你秉承“只要进门，我就服务”这种观念时，一切就会向刚刚讲到的一切的反方向去发展。

首先，你可能花了很多时间去学习新的知识，但最后却发现这些知识在为这个客户设计产品时用过一次后就再也派不上用场了。其次，你在学习这些新知识或是创建新的代码库时花费的时间完全本可以用于为某一个服务领域做一些营销工作。

也就是说，那些“只要进门，我就服务”的人是在弃绝自己真真正正去经营好生意、赚一笔快钱的良机。这就好比说，你放弃赚到一块钱的机会不顾，只为最后能捡到一分钱。这怎么看都不是明智之举。

在决定自己想要服务哪一具体类型的群体时，你只需问清楚自己两个问题就够了。

第一个，有没有哪个领域是你可以而其它开发者不可以提供独有经验或价值的领域？如果有，那你就找到了一个为你的客户提供价值的机会。

第二个，问问自己有没有哪一种类型的工作是你乐于去做的。

如果你选择的领域不能很好的回答以上两个问题中的任意一个，那你将会面临诸多问题。原因很简单。

首先，倘若你并不能提供独特的价值，那你只是机械地在做一些工作，最终会为难以维持生意而陷入沮丧。

其次，就算你不能提供真正独特的价值，但如果你对你做的工作真的很有热情，那你还是可以坚持机械地把生意做下去的。

选择一个自己擅长/有专门知识的领域，或者选择一个自己热衷的领域都将帮助你获得成功。

### 要想取得成功，开发者必须确定好自己服务项目和服务定价

当你选择好自己的市场定位之后，你就要开始运营了。这时你就需要确定好自己要为客户提供什么服务，每项服务又该如何收费呢。

**你的服务**

确定自己的服务项目看似是一件不需要花费多长时间就能搞定的事情，但这一步其实非常重要，你要在确定服务时考虑到好几个因素。此外，在确定价格时，很重要的一点是，你最好采用固定收费的模式而非按时收费。让我们一个一个来细看这些问题。

在确定服务项目时，每一个自由职业开发者都应注意三件事。分析完这三件事后，如果你意向中的服务项目选择合理，你就要考虑当前潜在市场的规模。这三件事是：

-   你对这一特定领域感兴趣的程度
-   你的服务项目可以扩大到哪种程度，以及
-   你将某些工作外包的能力。

然后，你可以观察一下市场，看看还有没有剩余的市场份额足以有理由让你把自己的服务项目推入运营。

一定记得你的服务项目一定是围绕你感兴趣的事物展开的，这点怎么强调都不为过。就像刚刚上一小节已经提到的，如果你所从事的工作让你就像下面这张图片中的人那样感到巨无聊，那你很可能会在累垮后就放弃了。

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/12/Bored-male-at-computer.jpeg)

选择一个总体来说在为之学习和工作时你会感到兴奋的领域，你才不会在工作时觉得一切都是单调乏味的苦差事。而且当你对工作有兴趣时，你才会投入更多的时间，相应的，你的现金流也将不会让你失望。所以说，再次强调，当你决定要去提供什么服务时，问清楚自己真正感兴趣的东西是什么。

选择服务项目时还很重要的一点是规模。规模一词并不难理解。随着营业额的增加，人人都会希望专注那些边际收益在增长或者至少持平的业务。

而那些让你能够重新利用已写完的代码库的业务就可以帮你实现上面所说的这种情况。

而有些业务却需要你总是从零做起并花费大量时间学习新知识，而且这些业务只适用于为极少数的客户提供服务，这些业务会让你越做越穷。在深入某一个业务时，一定问清楚自己，“我能把这项业务做大吗？”

需要考虑的最后一件事是你把一些工作外包的能力。你能把工作外包的能力越强，那么你就越可以通过利用他人的劳动力来发展自己的公司。

拿我们公司的主营业务来说，我们会将法律内容的撰写工作外包给希望将其作为副业的律师或法律专业学生。鉴于有大量的人具有执行这项工作的技能并正在寻找这样的机会，我们根本不用发愁找不到这项工作的外包。

再举一个例子来说，还很适合外包的是那些不会用到复杂代码库的产品。一款产品的构建越简单，就越容易雇用/外包其他开发人员来为你提供帮助。这样一来，你就不再需要让你手下具有很高技能的人去做这些工作了。

因此，在决定提供哪些服务项目时，你其实是在找这些业务：你要对它感兴趣，这项业务能够做大，且这项业务涉及的工作能够让你最大程度上进行外包。

确定好你的服务项目后，你就要去衡量一下这些业务的实际市场规模了。如果你的服务很好，但市场上却没有足够多的客户，那显而易见，这项业务并不能让你获利多少。但是，如果市场上有充足的客户，那你就可以借此大赚一笔了。

我们不妨一起来看看上面这些理论在实践中是如何发挥作用的。举个例子，我们最近成立的一家公司专注于以较低的介绍率为小型企业构建简单的（通常是单页）网站。

我们非常喜欢与小公司合作，并且鉴于我们需要建立的网站较为简单，我们将重新利用很多之前写的代码。另外，由于这些网站不需要进行太深入的JavaScript开发，也不需要HTML和CSS以外的其它开发，我们也可以把这项工作外包。因此，依照我刚刚提出的三个考虑因素来看，这项业务或许可以列为一项服务项目。

接下来，我们再看看这项业务有没有市场。就这点来说，正如我在  [“是否应该成为一名自由职业开发者”][10]  一文中提到的那样，2017年，在美国的2400万家小型企业中大约有30％没有或需要建立一个新网站，这就意味着我们有大约有720万的潜在客户（30％\ * 2400万）。

T这无疑是一个庞大且可获利的市场。这样一来，这项业务就不仅能够通过三个要素的测试，还能满足一个巨大的市场，我们就可以继续推出这项服务。

**定价**

明确了服务群体，定好了服务项目，接下来得定下来你的收费标准了。定价时非常重要的是，你要按项目统一收费，不要搞任何形式的按时收费。你还要试着建立一些经常性收入。接下来我会一一解释为什么。

你应该尽最大可能去按统一定价收费而非按时收费，这样能让你获得更多的利润，原因有以下几点。

第一，随着你对目标客户群的服务越来越娴熟，你完成一项工作的时间会越来越短。

假如说你接手了一个价值$5,000的项目，最后花了50个小时把活全部干完。那你的时薪就是$100/h。现在设想过了几个月后，你接到了一个类似的项目，你的收费仍是$5,000。

但这一次，你已经不用再去花那么多的时间去学习服务对象所在商业领域的知识了，你甚至还可以重新利用上一个项目的部分编码。这样一来，你花了仅仅30个小时就完成了第二个项目。

这也就意味着，你每小时所获得的收益从$100涨到了$166。但是如果你自始至终按照小时收费，你就白白浪费了过往经验和先前写好的代码的价值。

值得注意的是，在上面的例子中，虽然你在重复利用一些旧代码，但这绝不意味着你的第二个客户获得的价值因此受损。除了从你为他设计的产品中获得价值，他也会因你在他所在商业领域的经验增加而获利。你在构建类似应用程序中的经验也在为他创造价值。因为你的丰富经验意味着你为他设计的产品会更好用，bug会更少，等等。所以说，统一固定收费是一个双赢的收费模式。

除了固定收费标准，你还需要设立一些能够带来经常性收入的服务项目。以我们上面提到的那家专为小企业服务的公司为例，这家公司在为客户建立一个网站后还会提供后续的维护服务。我们会将客户的网站托管在我们的虚拟专用服务器上，并为客户提供所有网站相关最新信息。这项维护服务收费为每个月$50，这就是很好的一项经常性收入。

通过提供具有经常性收入来源的服务，可以让你的盈收更加稳定。

因此，总结起来，在决定价格时，请务必记住两点：“固定费用”和“经常性收入”。

### 自由职业开发者在建立生意时要选择合适的经营架构

确定了服务群体、服务项目、服务费用后，是时候建立你的生意架构了。

通常情况下，我会建议你组建一家有限责任公司来开展生意。这么做可以为你提供负债保护，而通常如果是独资经营者，你是不会获得负债保护的。（免责声明：本文观点不可充当为任何法律建议，作者本人并非法律专业人士。建议您寻求专业律师就您的个人情况进行咨询。）

一般而言，这种负债保护可以在发生诉讼时为你提供帮助，并且如果你的公司业务架构合理，还可以帮你免于独自一人承担商业债务的风险。另外，组建有限责任公司时还能享受税收优惠，我将在下面简要说明。

当你建立好一家有限责任公司后，很重要的是，一定要记得，你和你的公司是两个独立的法律个体。也就是说，你要把自己的私人银行账户和公司的企业账户区别开来，而且绝不可以用公司的账户去支付你的个人私人费用。

要想详细了解经营一家有限责任公司时相关的法律规定，还是那句话，找一位专业律师谈谈是很好的选择。

建立一家有限责任公司时，你还能享受到诸多税收优惠。具体情况你应向税务专业人士咨询，我在这里没有提供纳税建议的资格。

但总而言之，建立有限责任公司的好处包括刚刚提到的那些以及在对公司的利润征税时免征自雇税。读到这里你可以去休息一下，可以去填写  [IRS 表格 2553][11]  ，这样你才能被“选举”被视为一个S公司。对了，你还需要支付给自己一份合理的薪酬。

我不想把这部分内容搞得太长，在下面这个视频里面，我会在针对这点详细拆解，讲得会更细致一些。 

单是凭税收优惠这点，你就应该选择组建有限责任公司。再加上获得的负债保护，不用动脑子想你也应该建立有限责任公司。

### 一份针对准备开启自由职业的开发人员的行动事项清单

一定要为你的新公司做好十足的准备，这点非常重要，怎么强调也不为过。我深信，很多小公司倒闭的原因就是因为缺乏充足的准备。如果你能利用好时间，把事事都准备完善，那你就能免于太多小公司所历经的不幸命运。

你当下最迫切的需求清单如下：

-   确定好自己将如何为自己的新经营筹集资金

-   避开一切债务型或信用卡形式的融资
-   必要的话，先从事点副业，等钱攒够了再去大干一番

-   确定好你的新公司要为哪个客户群体服务

-   你选择的服务领域应是你喜欢的或是你感兴趣的
-   不要抱着“只要上门，我就服务”的理念去办生意，专注于为你的目标客户群服务

-   确定你的服务项目和服务收费标准

-   在确定定价和服务项目时，掂量一下自己有没有能力把这项服务做大，以及能够有能力外包，还要考虑这项服务有没有可服务的市场，市场规模有多大。
-   尽可能按固定标准统一收费，不要按时收费
-   确保你的经营模式里有能为你带来经常性收入的业务类别

-   组建公司时选择有限责任公司

-   尽早向专业律师人士咨询有关建立有限责任公司的优惠、法律规定细则
-   像专业人士咨询你的纳税问题，记得去填写申请公司注册的表格（同样要向税务专业人士咨询）

在你做好所有计划之后，现在你就可以正式把计划落地了。要想迈好第一步，你首先要确保你已经拥有你开办生意所需的一切了。

如果你万事尚未具备，那就会向要去跑步了你还光着脚一样。所以这一部分指南将会专门介绍你开办公司后需要立即去做的事情，以确保你能吸引到客户并让你的公司高效运作。

在这部分中，我们会深入探讨下面几点，主题分别是：

-   迈好第一步的重要性
-   需要完成的管理事项
-   需要完成的市场营销事项
-   活到老学到老的重要性

那我们就一个一个开始谈吧？

### 自由职业开发者必须认识到迈好第一步的重要性

Before I get into how to hit the ground running, it’s important that we discuss the need to start out well-organized and with all of your ducks in a row. It’s crucial for multiple reasons.

First is the fact that there is no easier time than right now to get organized. Think about it - as you get more customers and get busier, it’s only going to get harder to get things done.

Second, if you don’t have the items discussed below taken care of in advance, then they’re only going to get in the way once you’re trying to run full speed ahead.

In other words, starting out in a disorganized fashion will get in the way of trying to get your substantive work done. This, in turn, will interfere with your ability to do a good job for your clients.

A final, and crucial, reason to get organized now is that not doing so will make you work in an inefficient manner. This inefficiency will stem from the fact that you will constantly be interrupting your work to deal with administrative headaches. This leads to massive inefficiencies throughout your workflow. These inefficiencies will compound on one another and you will suffer from decreased profits as a result.

So, choose to get organized now and not later. This organization includes both your administrative needs and your marketing needs.

### Developers must get their administrative affairs in order when starting up

One of the biggest challenges to freelancers who are just starting up is dealing with the various administrative tasks involved with running a business. It’s easy to get in the mindset of “I’ll deal with these tasks later.” Such tasks, after all, can seem boring, confusing, and completely irrelevant to the actual work you’re doing.

Neglecting these items now, however, can create massive problems down the road. A little later this article will discuss how to deal with such things on an ongoing basis. For now, let’s look at the items that you need to deal with from the start.

The first item of business is to make sure you properly form a company. As mentioned above, it will often be the best course of action to form an LLC. The specifics of your situation, however, should always be discussed with a lawyer.

In addition to forming the company, it is important that you get any necessary business licenses and that you complete any other documentation required by your Secretary of State as well as your county level or city level governments. Some states will require more of this documentation than others.

Failing to properly obtain your necessary business licenses, or to obtain other necessary records, can result in you not having the legal right to do business. Make sure you’re properly complying with all requirements in this area.

The second item of business is to get your company its own mailing address. It is generally a good idea that your business have an address other than that of your residence.

First, it allows you to list an address on your website that is not your home. Second, doing so can prevent people from looking up the business on a Secretary of State’s website and getting your home address. Third, having a separate business address helps your company to appear more legitimate.

If you’re just starting out, and have few to no customers, then a post-office box may be your best bet. You can also look into shared working spaces (such as WeWork). Such spaces not only give you a place to work, but you will be provided with a mailing address as well.

The third item on the agenda is to open a bank account for the company. It is crucial that you do not intermingle your personal finances with the business finances. This company account is what you will use to pay for business-related expenses, to reimburse yourself for business expenses which you paid out personally, and to accept payments from customers.

Personally, I would suggest using a large national bank (such as Chase, Wells Fargo, and so on). The reason I suggest this is that the largest banks will be the most likely to integrate with various payment options, to have branches in every state, and so on.

Next up is to sign up for different software services as well as other services that you will need to run your business on a day to day basis.

First on this list is a business suite with which you can set up a branded email address, receive cloud storage for the company, and so on. We use G Suite in our company but here are plenty of other options, such as Office 365.

Next is to sign up for a service offering accounting software (I cannot stress enough the importance of keeping good books). There’s more below about how to keep the books in your business, but for now just know that you need to have accounting software set up from the get go.

For most freelancers I’d suggest trying  [Wave’s accounting software][13]. I suggest Wave because, while not as robust as Quickbooks Online (which many consider to be the gold standard for accounting software), it is much easier for non-accountants (a.k.a. “you”) to use.

Three other reasons to use Wave are,

-   it’s free,
-   it’s free, and
-   it’s free.

After you’ve signed up for your accounting software you’ll also need to sign up a payment processor so you can accept credit cards and e-checks. Most accounting software options also have an add-on component for payment processing. Personally, I find the option Wave offers to be acceptable and we use it in our company.

While not an exhaustive list, these are some of the services and software offerings which you should sign up for immediately.

It is also  **critical**  to have the contracts which you will use with your customers ready from the start. Not having a properly written contract can result in you not getting paid, in you getting paid less than what you thought you had bargained for, or even in you getting sued.

To explain the importance of contracts in some detail, and your options for preparing properly drafted agreements, we are fortunate enough to have this contribution from Cari Ross, an Ohio attorney with  [Ross Legal Services][14]  (the video embedded below is a larger course, but will open directly to the section containing Cari's lecture).  

Personally, I would suggest erring on the side of caution and retaining legal representation to review your agreements. Often, you can find an attorney who will review your documents for a one-time fee.

Another thing that I would strongly suggest is that you sign up for professional liability insurance on behalf of your business.

We maintain insurance in our company and it costs us less than $70 per month. If a client were to sue us, claiming that we bungled a product that we built, we would be able to turn the lawsuit over to our insurance company and they would deal with it. Having an insurance policy such as this makes it easier to sleep at night.

The foregoing list shouldn’t be considered as everything you will need to have starting out. These are, however, things which I don’t believe you should consider optional.

### Freelance developers should get their marketing infrastructure in place before starting up

Striking out as a freelancer means the opportunity to make money. You are going to need clients to make that money. You need to get your marketing infrastructure set up as soon as possible in order to get those clients.

Let’s go over a list of things which you should get set up from the get go. While some of the items on this list may make you say “duh – I know to set that up,” you’d be surprised at what some people don’t do before getting started.

The first order of business is to build your company website and to include a portfolio of your various projects. A great thing about freeCodeCamp is that you will have built some projects for your coursework even if you don’t have any customers yet.

It’s important to remember that your website is the equivalent of a store front. The level and quality of the work you put into it will go a long way in deciding how seriously your potential customers take you. Your site should highlight work you’ve done, make clear to the layperson what type of work you’re available to do, stress customer service, and make it easy for clients to contact you.

When you're building your website, it's important to consider your audience. All of us (including me) can be guilty of forgetting that most of our customers really don’t care about code or technology. They just want a solution to their problems.

A customer likely doesn’t know what HTML is and they don’t care if you're using Bootstrap, Flexbox, or some other framework to build a responsive page.

If you want people to become your customer then don’t alienate them by talking like a tech head on your website. Instead, present yourself as a problem solver that is ready to assist them.

The next crucial point is to have a branded email. You can take care of this by signing up for a business software suite, which I suggested above. Having a company email is important because you want your customers to take you seriously. And trust me that they won’t take you seriously if your email address is “name@gmail.com”. You might as well be using “brand\_new\_coder@gmail.com” if that’s the case. Get a branded email.

Another important item to get is a dedicated phone number for your business. There are a variety of reasons why you don’t want business calls going to your personal cell phone. These include the fact that clients will then have your personal number, you’ll be putting your personal number on your website, and you’ll have to answer personal calls with a professional sounding greeting (since you won’t know if it’s a potential customer calling).

The best way to deal with the separate number issue is to sign up for  [Google Voice][15]  \- which is included with any free Google account. This allows you to add a second VOIP number to your cell phone. You’ll be able to receive calls, make calls, and text from this number. And again, the beautiful part is that it’s free.

If, for some reason, you don’t want to use Google Voice or some other VOIP, you can always get a second cell phone. If you go the second cell phone route, make sure it is signed up under your LLC so that the monthly bill is deductible on your taxes.

A key, key, key, key (key) part to your marketing is going to be to sign up profiles on which clients can leave you positive online reviews. These include your profile on Google My Business, a business page on Facebook, and a Yelp profile for the business.

Many people, even those referred to you, will want to look at your online reviews prior to deciding to hire you. Failing to have a bank of reviews is going to cost you money, and a lot of it. I’ll be speaking more below about how you can actually go about getting those reviews. For this part of this guide, just be aware that you need to sign up and fully fill out these various online profiles.

Another important step is to make sure that your LinkedIn profile is as complete as possible. Make sure your profile makes clear that you are available for freelance work. You’ll want to include your various projects in your profile and make sure you list your various skills.

Also, I’d strongly suggest taking the various LinkedIn tests to gain their coding certifications. These tests only take a few minutes and, for example, your profile can indicate that you are actually certified by LinkedIn in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and so on. These certifications will go a long way towards prompting others to contact you for work.

These are simply some initial “must haves” that you need to get taken care of immediately. I’ll be discussing, in depth, how to actually get clients as you move further through this guide. For now, just be aware that you should have the above items before you dive into the world of trying to hustle up your next project.

### Freelance developers must decide to be continuous learners in order to succeed

Yep, perhaps you’ve just learned to code. But before you even get that first customer you should've already decided that you’re going to continue learning about a variety of topics.

In truth, coding only makes up a part of your business. And unless you decide to continuously improve your skills in a variety of other areas, you’re going to have problems. The areas about which you should be learning on an ongoing basis include:

-   communication/soft skills
-   personal and business finance
-   business history (in order to learn from the successes and mistakes of past entrepreneurs)
-   and more.

It’s important to remember that completing freeCodeCamp, and learning to code, is the beginning of a new chapter and not the end of an old one. If you want to succeed, get in the habit of lifelong learning before you even get your first customer. If you don’t want to succeed then, don’t worry, you never have to pick up another book again.

My suggestion would be to set aside some time every morning during which yo improve yourself through learning.

Personally (and this is just what I do), I read for forty-five minutes each morning. My daily routine consists of “wake up,” “eat a quick breakfast,” and then “open a book” for forty-five minutes. Again, this is what works for me.

Some initial readings I suggest include:

-   [Profit First][16]
-   [How to win friends and influence people][17]
-   [The Millionaire Next Door][18]
-   [Small Time Operator: How to Start Your Own Business, Keep Your Books, Pay Your Taxes, and Stay Out of Trouble][19]
-   [The Innovators][20]
-   [The Everything Store][21]

These are just my suggestions. I will say though, that each of these books went a long way in changing my outlook and making me better at business. One of the most common habits among super-successful people is continuous learning - so get to it.

### Action items for freelance developers who have just started their own business

Again, it’s important that you have all your ducks in a row before you start taking clients. That’s why I’ve put together this list of “to do” items that should be completed after you’ve formed your business and are preparing to start taking customers.

Your “to do” list for this section includes the following:

-   Administrative

-   Research the local business and licensing requirements for your new company and make sure you follow these requirements
-   Establish a separate address (such as a PO box) for your business
-   Open a separate bank account for your business
-   Sign up for “administrative software” that you will need

-   A business suite
-   Accounting software
-   Credit card processing
-   A payroll service

-   Develop/obtain the contracts you will have potential customers sign
-   Sign up for professional liability insurance

-   Marketing

-   Build out your website and online portfolio
-   Establish a branded email
-   Establish a dedicated phone number for your business
-   Sign up the profiles necessary for your business to receive online reviews (Google My Business, Yelp, etc.)
-   Build out your LinkedIn profile

-   Continuing Education

-   Make a plan to become a lifelong learner
-   Execute on the plan to become a lifelong learner

## Freelance developers need to start finding clients after their business is organized, up, and running ([back to top][22])

Once your business is planned, formed, and your initial “to do” list is taken care of, there’s something you will need:  **customers**_._  Hustling up business is going to be crucial for anyone just starting out.

Like anything else there’s a right way and a wrong way to go about getting business. I fully recognize that you will need clients now, in the short term, while you are building your new empire.

It is vital, however, that you don’t make the mistake of focusing only on getting clients in the short term and, as a result, don’t do the things needed to build a venture that is sustainable for the long-term.

In this section of our guide we’ll be discussing the following:

-   The importance of building your long term business while still getting clients in the short term
-   How to sell yourself to your clients
-   Sources of business for the short term
-   How to build your company over the long term
-   A list of action items to get rolling with immediately

With that said - on to the next section!

### Freelance developers must get business in the short term while focusing on their long-term business

Before we get into how to get clients for your new business, it’s important to discuss your strategies over both the short and long term.

In the short term you will be working to hustle up work, to make a few bucks today, while over the long term you’re going to build a brand. The value of having a brand is that you will be able to get more work, with less effort, and will often be able to charge higher prices.

Unfortunately, too many developers get caught in a trap. This trap involves developers putting all of their time and resources into getting clients today in the short term. These developers can never rest easy and know that they’ll have a steady flow of business and, quite often, spend many years working at reduced rates.

By building your brand over the long term you’ll be able to avoid this trap while still making money in the meantime.

The difference between a short term hustle and a durable brand is simple. Short term hustles involve you spending quite a bit of time and money convincing others to let you do work for them. Again, this work will often be at a reduced or mediocre rate.

Having a brand means that people will seek you out, as opposed to the other way around, and you can then charge higher rates. The latter is a path to success while the former will make you feel like you’re stuck on a hamster wheel like this guy:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/hampster-wheel.jpg)

Now let’s figure out how you can avoid getting stuck like this. We’ll start by looking at how you’ll get clients today and then move on to building your brand.

The first part of getting clients today is learning how to sell yourself to potential customers.

### Developers can sell themselves to clients by playing the role of a problem solver

It’s impossible to succeed as a freelance developer unless you’re able to effectively sell your services to clients. A big problem for most freelancers, however, is that they don’t go about selling their services in the right way.

This is often because, as developers, we tend to think that we are selling code and products to clients. The fact of the matter, however, is that we are selling solutions to clients' problems. When we see ourselves as “developers,” instead of “problem solvers,” we tend to fail to effectively communicate our value to a client.

The truth, at the end of the day, is that a client won’t hire someone if they don’t see value in the services being provided. By presenting ourselves as solving our clients' problems, we can show how much value we are providing and, in turn, the client will want to hire us.

Consider the following example. Suppose your are called by a local pizza shop that wants to develop a new website. They want to implement online ordering, and they also want to develop a mobile app so that people can order food while on the go.

You go to the pizza shop and explain which language you will build the app in and start speaking technical mumbo jumbo which the shop owner probably doesn’t understand.

After your presentation, the shop owner won’t understand the difference between what you’re going to build and what someone else can build, for less money, in a CMS such as WordPress. They are simply left with your word that your product is “better” without any understanding as to why.

This shop owner is not likely to hire you because all they want, at the end of the day, is something that meets their needs.

Now suppose that you go to the pizza shop and have a conversation with the owner in which you take the time to understand their needs and goals. You then show them how the website and app you are going to build can meet those goals. You’re doing this while using little to no technical jargon.

You then explain, in layman’s terms, why the person using a CMS won’t meet those goals (for example - you may specifically explain how limited the CMS’ functionality will be when translated into an app).

Now you’ve spoken to the owner in  **their**  language and they see value in the service you’re providing. They are now more likely to hire you because you spoke to their needs, through the lens of a problem solver, without using “tech head” speak.

Do you want to close more sales with clients? If so, then it’s simple. Present yourself as a “problem solver” and don’t speak code. Once you start freelancing, you need to stop seeing yourself as a developer and, instead, recognize that your purpose is to solve a client’s problem in the most efficient way possible.

Now that you know how to sell your services to clients, let’s look at how to go about getting business over the short term.

### There are several ways for freelance developers to get immediate business

There are several ways to get clients in the short-term. As you will see in the following discussion, these methods  **do not**  involve spending large sums of money (or any money for that matter). Let’s take a look at how you can immediately get clients through the following types of resources:

-   Leveraging of your existing contacts
-   Services such as Upwork and Thumbtack
-   Services such as Fiverr
-   Free advertising through Craigslist
-   Networking groups, such as BNI

Let’s dive into the pros and cons of each of these.

A good place to start getting clients is by simply leveraging your friends and contacts. What I AM NOT saying is for you to simply start telling everyone you know that you are now a freelance coder and you want to build them a project.

Instead you take the approach of telling various individuals that you are embarking on this venture and that you just wanted to let them know of your availability in case they come across anyone who needs your services. Also, make sure that you give them some of your business cards. I wouldn’t suggest bringing it up again after these initial mentions - then you’re just annoying your friends and acquaintances.

I’ll give a personal example of how powerful it can be to simply reach out to your circles.

I recently spun up a separate business which will assist small to medium sized businesses/entities with basic web design. First, I mentioned to one friend that I was starting this service, in the “fyi” fashion I described above. The friend became excited and quickly told me that her mom had founded a church (something I didn’t know) and the church needed a new site designed.

Second, I mentioned that I would be starting the new business to my next door neighbor (who is self employed) and that I would drop him off some business cards just in case he came across any entrepreneurs who needed help. His wife quickly mentioned to me that the parent-teacher organization at the school their child attends wanted to build a new website.

So, two conversations wound up yielding $6,000 worth of work for what are actually very simple projects. And these were just the first two conversations I had. You get the point. So, making your availability known to your immediate circles can be a great way to get started.

The next step is to sign up for services such as Upwork and Thumbtack. These are platforms on which consumers can state what services they need and ask for proposals. You will typically pay for the ability to submit a proposal and these jobs will often be for lower amounts than what you would normally charge.

Is this perfect? Nope. Is it good for someone just getting started? Yep, and especially so when the alternative is to sit around and twiddle your thumbs.

There are a few things to make sure of when signing up for these types of services. First, you need to make sure that you fill out your profile as robustly as possible. Include introductory videos for yourself and your services if the platform allows them.

Also, as you complete projects it is important to ask clients for reviews if you are sure that they will leave you good feedback. As you build up a bank of reviews, you’ll be able to bid on higher priced jobs available through these services.

While these types of services aren’t a good way to get rich, they are a good way to start building up a portfolio of work while getting paid for doing so.

The next option is to set yourself up as a service provider through a company such as Fiverr. If you are unfamiliar with Fiverr, it is a website that essentially allows you to set up a store front and provide services in different categories. The available categories include web and software development.

As with Upwork and Thumbtack, you’ll typically be providing services for a good amount less than your normal “going rate.” With that said, Fiverr simply brings the customers to you and you pay a portion of your fee to the service. You are not paying up front for the leads.

Personally, I prefer this approach over services like Upwork. This is because you are not paying for leads and, perhaps more importantly, you are not putting time into submitting proposals for work that you may or may not get.

As with the other services discussed above, it's important to do a good job for your customers, to provide quality service, and to get good reviews. This will allow you to charge more over time. Again, while not a long term solution, this is a good option for getting started.

Another option that you’ll want to take advantage of is advertising on Craigslist. For reasons which go beyond my understanding, this remains a highly under-utilized option. You can advertise your services on Craigslist at the cost of $5 per post and a post will last up to 30 days.

Depending on how many people are using Craigslist in your area, one post may still be visible, without being pushed to the bottom, for the entire month. In other areas, it may be necessary to post once a day or so.

When creating a Craigslist ad, I’d strongly suggest that you do a few things. First, create a graphic to insert into the post. This should include your name, the services you provide, contact information, and so on. The standard size for a Craigslist graphic is 600 x 450 pixels. Also, you can use a limited amount of HTML when writing the text of your advertisement. So make it look nice.

Right now you may be thinking “Craigslist?” My answer to this is “yep!” People always look at me oddly when I tell them that this is an under-utilized option. Over the years I’ve suggested to various businesses (including attorneys, realtors, and others) that they advertise on the service. The same naysayers are then surprised at the fact that they actually make money doing so. These won’t be high end clients (you’ll typically only be doing very basic web design). But, again, it’s revenue to help you get started.

A final option for those starting out (and an important one at that) is to join a networking group through your local  [BNI chapter][23]. BNI (short for “Business Networking International”) is a worldwide networking group which focuses on helping entrepreneurs grow their businesses through  **effective**  networking (I stress the effective part). I’ll be writing an article in the future on how to network the “right way” (spoiler alert).

In short, BNI is a way to have other business owners refer you business whenever the opportunity arises in exchange for you doing the same. It also allows you to meet entrepreneurs with whom you can form a business synergy.

If, for example, you want to build websites and apps for small businesses then you will likely need a photographer to help companies produce proper photographs of their products. Your local BNI chapter may include a photographer to whom you can refer business. That photographer, in turn, may refer you business whenever they do work for a company which mentions wanting to improve their web presence.

Don’t underestimate the power of networking, when it’s done correctly. BNI really does give you the opportunity to “level up” your networking efforts.

One of the downsides of the networking route is that it can be quite time-consuming. Also, if a referral source ever decides to get out of the game, then you lose your flow of business.

These are just some of the reasons why you can make a few bucks in the beginning through networking, as well as the other methods discussed above, but it remains important to build your brand and long-term business. Let’s talk about how to do so.

### Freelance developers must build their brand and company over the long-term

It’s one thing to put time and effort into your business and to get a few bucks back in return. The real power of working for yourself, however, comes from building a brand and an actual company. You will then be able to charge higher rates and customers will seek you out, as opposed to you having to find them.

Building an actual brand/company helps you look like this:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/Man-pulling-in-money.jpg)

I’m assuming that you find this type of look acceptable. In order to get there, you need to build something enduring. There are several aspects to and options for doing so. Let’s take a look at the following:

-   Why repeat customers, and referrals from former customers, will always be your most important source of business
-   The importance of online reviews
-   Leveraging a blog
-   Leveraging YouTube

Let’s dive into each of these, shall we?

The first point, which I cannot stress enough, is that you have to provide your customers with both high quality service and a high quality product. This makes them want to use you again in the future and, importantly, turns them into a referral source.

Why is this so important? Simple - you can’t succeed otherwise. Think of it like this: Your marketing efforts lead to a phone call from Joe the baker. Joe has you build a basic $2,500 website for his bakery. You do a good job for Joe.

Six months later he refers you his friend, Bob the restaurant owner, who pays another $2,500 for a restaurant website. Then you do a great job for Bob and he later refers you someone.

Do you see what just happened? Your marketing only led to one phone call from Joe, yet that one phone call indirectly turned into two additional phone calls.

The above example relates to a crucial point. You’re not going to make it if you have to generate a marketing related phone call for every eventual customer. Doing so is resource intensive and kills your profit margins (if you’re able to stay in business at all).

If Freelancer “A” earns 10x the revenue of Freelancer “B”, it’s not because A’s marketing yields 10x as many calls. It’s because, while they do get more calls, they make sure that one phone call yields more than one customer.

This is how you grow your business exponentially. Conversely, if growing your revenue by 10x requires you upping your marketing by 10x then…….good luck with that.

So how do you make sure that you’re earning repeat business and referrals?

First, deliver a quality product in the time frame that you promise and DO NOT make excuses.

Second, be timely in responding to phone calls, emails, and other customer communications. Be courteous and simply treat your customer the way you would want to be treated.

In short - provide good service. While this may sound like something that makes you go “duh,” you’d be surprised at how many developers fail in this area.

Another important part of building a brand/enduring business is to consistently get good online reviews from your customers. Even if you're dealing with customers from a wide range of geographical areas, it’s vital that you have a bank of reviews with which potential customers can evaluate whether they want to hire you.

You can also refer potential customers to these reviews for their consideration. The reason I’m stressing this is that good reviews mean that your marketing won’t need to generate as many phone calls for your to make money. Let’s use a hypothetical to explain why this is.

Suppose that every $1,000 devoted to marketing, by Joe Developer, generates two paying customers. Now suppose that each of these customers pays Joe an average of $3,000. This means Joe nets $5,000 for the first $1,000 in marketing \[($3k \* 2 customers) - $1k of marketing expenses\].

Now suppose Joe wants to double his business. He spends $2,000 on marketing this month and nets a total of $10,000 after expenses. This sounds fine and good until you consider the epic story of Jill Developer.

Jill Developer regularly gets good online reviews from customers while Joe doesn’t think that such reviews are important. As a result, people who find Jill online, or via referral, are more likely to hire her. As a result, Jill gets three clients for every $1,000 in marketing as opposed to Joe’s two clients.

So, Jill’s first three clients yield a net profit of $8,000 \[($3k \* 3 customers) - $1k of marketing expenses). This is  **sixty percent** higher than what Joe gets for his first $1,000 in marketing spend. When Jill doubles her marketing budget, her $8,000 in profit jumps to $16,000.

Do you see how the gap in income is going to continue to grow between her and Joe, even though they are increasing their marketing budgets by the same amount? Getting good online reviews turns more of your marketing dollars into actual revenue. Neglecting the accumulation of reviews will leave you spinning your wheels.

There are a few tips to follow when it comes to reaching out to your customers for good reviews. First, while it may sound obvious, don’t ask for a review unless you’re sure the customer will actually leave a good one (you’d be surprised what some people do).

Second, it’s important to get the reviews on websites which people actually visit (Yelp, Google, Facebook, and so on).

Third, don’t just ask customers to leave you reviews. Simply asking will result in a very low percentage of your clients actually doing so.

Instead, once you’ve completed the project, call your client and thank them for their business. Then make sure they know that if they ever need anything they can give you a call. Ask if there was anything you could have done to improve your services and, if they are happy, ask if they will leave you an online review. Once they say “yes,” thank them and let them know that you will send them an email with review links. That email should look something like this:

Dear \[name of customer\],

Thank you for allowing us to assist you. As I mentioned, I’m including a few links for online reviews. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to say a few kind words. The links below will take you directly to our review profiles:

-   Google
-   Yelp
-   Facebook

If we can ever be of assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

Thanks again,  
\[Your name\]

The links to your review profiles should go straight to the review section and not the general page. You’ll find that this approach will lead to many more customers who say they are going to leave you a review, actually doing it.

Another tool for building a lasting brand is to develop a blog which speaks to the needs of your customers. This has been a key to our primary business which deals with providing solutions for law firms.

The key to developing a successful blog is to provide information that is, again, useful to your customers and not simply that which you want to write about.

Why do I stress this? Simple: one of the most common blogging mistakes I see is people taking the approach of “I’m going to write on the things I want to write about” as opposed to writing on the topics about which their potential customers are seeking information. Let me give you two examples of what I mean.

I wrote an article on how law firms can use Evernote as a tool for reducing clutter in their office. Over time, my analytics showed that article consistently receiving traffic. Since the article was popular, I wrote a comprehensive series of articles on how law firms can leverage Evernote to make their offices more efficient. Each of the articles in that series went on to generate significant traffic for our website.

Conversely, I also wrote a series of articles on how law firms could improve their cyber security (you would think this would be a big deal to those who handle sensitive information). The thing was, however, that our analytics showed those articles were receiving little to no traffic. In other words, our potential customers simply weren’t looking for the information (maybe that’s why law firm cybersecurity is so bad - but that’s a rant for a later time).

The moral of the story is this - monitor your analytics and write more on the topics that are proving to be popular and stop writing on the topics that are not popular. You’ll be surprised how many potential customers pick up the phone and call you as a result of you providing useful information.

As with a blog, it is also a good step to start a YouTube channel. The steps for integrating YouTube into your brand building are very similar to those involved in building a blog. This means that you should leverage your analytics and do videos on the topics your customers show interest in. Do not devote energy to topics which your customers are clearly not interested in.

Also, it’s important to actually put some effort into your YouTube videos. Do a few takes so you are putting out a quality product. Make sure you have adequate lighting, use a microphone, and do some basic video editing at a minimum (there are a ton of free/low cost and easy to use editors out there).

The one thing I’ll add on YouTube is that it’s natural to be nervous and apprehensive about doing video. Just remember this: the biggest YouTubers didn’t start out big. If you look at their early videos you’ll see a big difference in quality from where they started and where they are today. Everyone has to start somewhere, after all.

The big thing to remember, as we close out this section, is that you can make a few bucks with short-term strategies. Building a brand, however, will give you something which no one can take away and will lead to a far more lucrative business.

### Action items for freelance developers who are ready to start bringing in business

The foregoing discussion provided information about how you can bring in business in both the short and long-term. It also discussed the importance of brand building so that you can increase your profits.

The following is a “to do” list which will help you get a stream of customers a flowin’:

-   Start to think of yourself as a “problem solver” and not a developer

-   Remember that your customers don’t care about code or technology. They only care about getting their needs met.
-   Begin brainstorming the potential issues that your customers face, and how you can discuss a solution to those issues in ways that your customers will understand.
-   Work on your “active listening” skills so that you can “hear” the needs and concerns which your potential customers are conveying.

-   Begin the process of “short-term” business building so you have immediate revenue

-   Make everyone you know aware that you are starting up. The goal of these conversations is not to sell your services to your current circles. Instead, it is to turn your current circles into referral sources.
-   Complete a robust LinkedIn profile. Your profile should make clear that you are a freelance developer accepting work.
-   Create robust profiles for yourself on services such as Upwork and Thumbtack. Consider bidding for jobs through these services.
-   Make your services available through Fiverr and begin advertising on Craigslist as well.
-   Join BNI or other similar networking groups.

-   Begin the process of long-term brand building

-   Create profiles for your business on Google My Business, Yelp, and Facebook. Begin getting client reviews on these websites and make the acquisition of reviews an ongoing process.
-   Develop a blog which speaks to the needs of your customers. Leverage your analytics over time to ensure that you are writing on topics which interest your customers.
-   Develop a YouTube channel which also speaks to the needs of your customers. As with a blog, leverage your analytics to ensure that you’re doing videos on the correct topics. Make sure you put some effort into your video production. This includes considering your scripting, lighting, sound quality, etc.

## Freelance developers must develop systems to manage their business on a day-to-day basis ([back to top][24])

Once you have customers coming in the door then it is vital to ensure that you properly manage your business on a day-to-day basis. Failing to do so will lead to inefficiencies and wasted time. This leads to two horrible things - decreased profits and unhappy customers.

Assuming you want to avoid these things, it’s important that you embrace your new role of business manager in addition to that of being a developer. When managing your business, you should focus on the administrative side of things as well as on the substantive work to be done. Failing to do so will lead to administrative problems which will pop up at bad times. These problems will then get in the way of your substantive work.

So, while administrative tasks may seem boring, it is vital that you give them the attention they deserve.

Too many freelance developers get into the mindset of thinking “I’m a developer, not a businessperson.” Well, if you take this mindset once you start freelancing then you won't have to worry about being a businessperson. Because you’ll go out of business so fast that the problem will simply take care of itself.

If you want to avoid this fate then focus on running all aspects of your business correctly.

This section is going to focus on the following areas when it comes to running your operation:

-   Managing your business’s administrative and financial affairs.
-   Managing your substantive development work in an efficient and profitable manner.
-   An action list meant to help you develop procedures for keeping your business running.

Again, I can’t stress enough the importance of seeing yourself as a “businessperson” and understanding that your business is now development. Think of it this way - if a chef starts a restaurant and makes themselves head cook, they are now a restaurateur and not a “chef.” The same is true for your new business. Now let’s get to it.

### Freelance developers must focus on their business’ administrative and financial management

The reason why I’m discussing the management of your administrative affairs before the management of substantive work is simple - this is the area where most freelancers get themselves into trouble.

Neglecting your administrative affairs leads to problems which have to be dealt with immediately. This means having to drop whatever current development task you're working on, telling a customer that there is going to be a delay, and putting out an unnecessary fire.

A simple example, which I’ve seen more than once, is the small business owner who never does their bookkeeping. At the end of the year, those books must be done so that the business can file its tax return. The business’ return must be filed so that the developer can file their individual returns.

Once tax filing deadlines are getting close, the small business owner has to drop everything, run around like crazy, and blow off their substantive work in order to get twelve months worth of bookkeeping figured out.

All of this could have been avoided by spending a small amount of time each week simply doing the books. Such weekly bookkeeping could have been handled in an orderly fashion, planned as part of a workflow, and handled in a way which did not disrupt the business.

The first step in managing your freelance business’ administrative affairs is to develop a monthly budget for the company as well as financial restraints.

Far, far, far, far (far) too many small business owners utilize “bank balance budgeting.” By this I mean that they simply look at their bank balance and they assume that having “X” in the bank means that they have “X” at their disposal. Gee, with an approach like that I can’t imagine why so many people have financial problems.

The  **crucial**  first step for your new venture is to set up a financial system. How to do so would be a very lengthy guide in and of itself. So, for the purposes of this guide, I strongly suggest that you read the book  [Profit First][25]  and implement its suggested systems. While there are certainly other possible approaches, I think this book gives a solid framework which will help those who struggle with financial management.

A key thing to remember when running a business is that your company’s bank accounts are not your personal account. You do not get to simply raid the business funds anytime you like.

An issue which I see far too often is when a business owner takes excessive withdrawals from their business account for personal purposes. The business then finds itself short on cash when bills are due and, to make up for this shortfall, the business owner then takes work at a reduced price to generate immediate cash. This reduced price work means there is still not much money in the business account and the owner has a hard time getting their personal bills paid.

This begins a difficult cycle which can be hard to break. By practicing financial restraint, you can avoid this trap.

The next critical point is that you regularly perform your accounting and understand your business’ books. I never understand the small business owners who don’t do their books regularly. Such business owners, as a result of not doing their bookkeeping, never actually know how much money they’re making. This can lead to a belief that you’re doing better or worse than you actually are.

To put it simply, if you’re not going to be regular about doing your books then don’t go into business for yourself.

How to do your books could easily be a course in and of itself. Fortunately, Erin Lehr of  [KPI Bookkeeping][26]  was willing to put together a group of instructional videos meant to get you started when it comes to keeping your books. She also put the slides from her presentation together into two separate documents. You may download her slides on money management  [here][27]  and her sample chart of accounts  [here][28].

Again, the following videos are introductory only (Erin's videos are embedded into a larger course, this link will open directly to her section of the video):

Again, and not to beat a dead horse, but it’s crucial that you handle your books regularly. If you need assistance then contact a bookkeeper such as Erin. Don’t neglect this chore.

One last point I’ll make, regarding managing your finances, is that you need to understand the difference between not having any business and not having any money.

I’ve consulted for way too many small businesses who call me freaking out because they have no money in the bank. The freaking out entrepreneur, however, starts these conversations by saying that business is dead. In other words, they assume that the fact that they’re broke is due to business being slow.

Upon talking to such people, however, it turns out that they actually have quite a bit of business. It’s just that they spent the money as fast as it came in, usually on indulgences (including large indulgences such as high end cars).

“Not having any business” would mean that you’re twiddling your thumbs and that you have nothing to be working on. If you’ve got a mountain of work to do, and no money, then it’s probably a sign that you need to practice better financial restraint.

It is vital that you manage your administrative tasks as well as affairs involving your finances. Administrative tasks include timely filing of any necessary documents with the Secretary of State, keeping your business licenses up to date, and so on.

Not keeping these affairs in order could be devastating. You don’t want to be sitting there, in the middle of a coding project, only to find out that you’ve lost your legal right to do business for the time being, all because you didn’t file a piece of paper with a regulatory entity. Know your licensing and regulatory requirements and, if necessary, hire an attorney to help you with these matters.

### Freelancers must manage their development in an efficient manner

A freelance developer’s “substantive” work consists of the tasks which they are actually paid to perform. In other words - development work.

If you’ve come this far into this guide then I think it’s fair to assume you’re interested in making money. Assuming that you are on a quest for prosperity, and that you haven’t read this article because there was nothing interesting at the public library, we’ll devote this section to making your substantive work as profitable as possible.

As mentioned above, the key is to identify your high value activities and to ensure that such activities receive a serious and efficient time commitment on your end.

To help you get there, this section will discuss the need to focus on the right tasks, how to make sure you’re putting in the right amount of time, and tips for making sure that you’re using that time efficiently. If you focus on these things, then you’re likely to make more money. If you don’t…then you’re not.

The most important part of getting rich is making sure that you’re focusing your time into higher value activities. This concept is pretty simple: identify the tasks which yield the best results and  **do more of those tasks**!

While that sentence may leave you going “duh,” you’d be surprised at how many entrepreneurs fail to recognize this concept. Let’s look at some specific examples, both in terms of your substantive work and your marketing activities.

Suppose you develop what you consider to be a typical small business website for $3,000. The site includes multiple pages, lots of media, and extra functionality (such as online ordering for a restaurant).

Now say that such a project typically takes you about twenty hours to complete. This means that this type of work yields you $150 per hour ($3k/20 hours).

Now suppose that you can drum up work building one-page “starter websites” for small businesses for $500 a pop. You can typically handle such projects in two hours (given that you’ll likely develop a number of templates to work from). This means these “starter” sites can be completed at a rate of $250 per hour ($500/2 hours).

While the latter may pay less in total than the former, it actually pays more per unit of input. A developer who actually wants to make money would focus on doing more “starter” sites and less on the larger projects I mentioned.

While the math I just laid out may seem obvious, you would be shocked at how many developers (and small business owners for that matter) fail to focus on the work which yields the most per unit of input. This can be due to not keeping track of the inputs (i.e. not tracking how much time you’re putting into something) or simply focusing on the price tag as opposed to the hourly profit.

Whatever the reason, those who fail to identify their most profitable activities, and focus on them, are making a big mistake.

Mark Cuban is on record as saying that diversification is “for idiots” and Warren Buffett is on record as referring to diversification as “madness.”

This is also true when it comes to the activities you are engaging in as a freelancer. If you identify an activity as being more profitable than any others then it makes NO sense to engage in other activities. Instead, you should be trying to drum up as much of that profitable activity as possible.

This is true in terms of your substantive work, your marketing activities, and pretty much anything else. In short - focus on high value activities.

Once you identify your high value activities then it is vital that you put a lot of time into them. Think about how much you need to work should as a function of efficiency and time (a few speeches from Elon Musk really opened my eyes to this).

Consider it in these terms: Jill and Joe perform similar tasks as freelance developers. Jill, however, works twenty-five percent more efficiently than Joe, meaning that Jill can get twenty-five percent more done in an hour.

You might think that Jill is going to make more money than Joe, right? The problem, however, is that Jill only works thirty hours a week and thinks her increased efficiency makes up for any lost time. Joe, by contrast, works forty hours every week. At the end of the week, Jill’s thirty hours of work will produce the same amount that Joe would produce in 37.5 hours (30 hours worked by Jill \* 1.25 of Joe’s efficiency).

Since Joe works forty hours each week, he’s going to get more done than Jill. Since Joe produces more than Jill, due to his better work ethic, he will make more as a freelance developer. If Jill had just worked forty hours, like Joe, then one week would yield an amount of production that would have taken Joe fifty hours (40 hours \* 1.25 Joe’s production = 50).

What you can take from the epic story of Jill and Joe is that you  _have to put in the hours while working as efficiently as possible_.

The foregoing concept is why I put a  _minimum_ of 43.3 hours into my business each week. My hourly requirement of 43.3 hours is based on a simple formula: if I’m working at the same level of efficiency as some hypothetical person, and that individual only works forty hours a week, then by putting in 3.3 extra hours per week I add one working month to my year.

In other words, someone working at the same level of efficiency as myself, who is only putting in forty hours a week, will take thirteen months to equal the level of production I reach in twelve months.

It’s important to stress that the average of 43.3 hours a week is a  **minimum**  that I put in. If there is additional work which must get done due to some type of deadline, then I put in extra time. Any extra time that I put in can then be taken off from a later week.

When working efficiently, however, it isn’t too often that I have to go over my 43.3 hours. By adding an extra working month to my year, using this method, I feel my production greatly increases.

The point of putting in your hours is so important that I’m going to rant about it for just another moment. An overhyped belief is that it is important to work “smarter not harder.” To this idea I say:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/wrong.jpeg)

It is, instead, important to work smart  **and**  hard. I deal with plenty of self-employed individuals who put in many of hours and manage to get nothing done. This is because they work in an extremely inefficient manner. You can put in sixty hours a week, but if you’re only working at fifty percent efficiency, then the average Joe will equal your production in just thirty hours a week.

At the same time, the math shown above in the hypothetical about Jill and Joe shows that you do need to put in the time. This is why the amount you produce, which largely dictates how much you make, is a function of  **both**  working efficiently and putting in the time. There can be no compromise on either.

Here’s an important tip, which I cannot stress enough, for working as efficiently as possible: always assume that you’re operating inefficiently.

I work with way, way, way (way) too many people that are convinced that they are operating in an efficient manner. After going through how they do things, however, it quickly becomes obvious that improvements can be made.

My approach to my business is to assume that I am inefficient and to be in a constant state of trying to do things better. Remember that no matter how well you think you are doing, there is always room to do better.

Now that we’ve gone over the importance of identifying high value activities and putting time into them, let’s give some specifics on how you can run your business more efficiently.

Again, it’s vital that you streamline your operations. It’s too easy, after all, to work all day, not get anything done, and then go home feeling like you’ve actually accomplished something simply because you put in time.

The tips below (which by no means should be considered an exhaustive list) will help you eliminate “noise” which causes unnecessary distractions, eliminate unnecessary work, and avoid self-inflicted extra tasks. Let’s get to it.

**How to work more efficiently:**

The first step for working efficiently is to develop the  _Only Handle It Once_  (O.H.I.O.) method. This is a straightforward time-saving idea which too many entrepreneurs fail at.

The idea is simple.  **Do not**  deal with an item unless you are prepared to take action on it at the time you deal with it. Consider how often the following occurs. Joe receives an email from a customer. He skims it and says to himself “I’ll deal with this later.” When “later” comes, Joe then has to read the email a second time before dealing with it. In other words, Joe to take the time to read the email twice instead of just reading it once and dealing with it.

Now multiply the wasted time of one extra reading by every email received in the course of a year. The time lost quickly becomes mind-boggling. Instead of making this mistake, Joe should not even open the email until he is prepared to deal with it. This will save him the time of a second reading.

The O.H.I.O. method can be applied to a number of different contexts. Imagine every piece of administrative paperwork you receive (notices from the Secretary of State, forms you have to fill out, and so on). As with the email example above, it’s easy to look at such a document and put it off to the side for later handling. Again, when the task is completed this means you will have reviewed the document twice.

The idea of Only Handle It Once means just what it says - do not open an email, pick up a piece of paper, or start a task unless you are prepared to actually deal with it. The time savings that come out of this method can be extreme.

The next step for working more efficiently is to adopt the mindset that you’re not going to start on something until you finish it. In other words, don’t spend a little time each day working on numerous projects. Finish one project and move on to the next one. Failing to do this means that you never get into a groove with your work.

Let me explain this by way of personal example. A big part of our primary business is adding blog posts to our client’s websites. Also, we recently switched our virtual private server from the company we were using to Siteground. As a result of this switch, we had to migrate all of the websites we manage from one server to another (this was a lengthy process).

In regards to adding client content, and migrating websites, we could have taken the approach of adding content to a few sites each day and migrating a few sites each day. This would mean constantly switching tasks, however. So, instead, we set aside time where we weren’t going to add content and were going to devote ourselves to site migration until it was finished.

Once that was done, we devoted ourselves to adding content to the websites until that project was completed. In other words, we finished one thing before we moved on to the next.

The benefit of this is extreme: when you switch tasks it takes time to get into a groove with the task you just switched to. This “lost groove time” greatly reduces your efficiency. It is, therefore, important to finish one task before moving on to another. Don’t keep jumping back and forth between partially completed projects.

When taking on new freelance projects, I take a “one at a time approach.” If I’m building something out for customer One, and I know it’s going to take me a week, then I let potential customer Two know that I won’t be starting their project for a week. I also adjust my proposed delivery date accordingly.

Manage your workflow so that you’re working on one thing at a time, but so that you have a stream of work lined up.

It is common for us to have multiple projects lined up and under contract. We, however, always finish one before moving on to the next. We do not jump back and forth between projects. This allows us to get more done, in less time, and we make more money as a result.

The third step to increasing your efficiency is to deal with problems as soon as they arise. And when I say “as soon as they arise,” I mean immediately. Not doing so will simply allow the problem to swell and become larger.

Here’s a simple example - my business partner pointed out to me the other day that the app we use for syncing contacts between everyone’s email accounts wasn’t working. I immediately stopped what I was doing to fix it.

It would have been easy to say “I’ll deal with this later.” In between that moment and later, however, people in our organization would have needed to make notes about customers, to pull up contact info, and so on. The app not syncing would have created problems in others’ workflow. This would result in a small problem (the app not working) compounding into larger issues.

Not dealing with inefficiencies immediately can compound in other ways. Consider this real world example: I was once talking to a customer on the phone while they were heading to their office. Once they got to their office, it took them extra time to get in the door. This was due to the fact that the customer had an excessive number of keys on their keychain and she said “I don’t even know what most of these keys are for” while we were talking. When I talked to the customer again, about a year later, they made the same comment.

Now consider this - the customer probably loses thirty seconds a day fumbling through keys that didn’t even need to be on her key ring. That’s 2.5 minutes lost per week. Over the course of the year that works out to roughly two full hours that are lost. 2.5 hours of substantive work likely works out to several hundred dollars. If this customer had taken a time out to take unnecessary keys off of their key chain immediately after realizing it was a problem, they would be making several hundred dollars more a year.

The foregoing story of the key ring may seem silly to some. It proves the point, however, of dealing with issues as soon as they arise. Failing to do so results in ongoing lost production. Taking the approach of “I’ll deal with this minor annoyance later” will result in you losing many hours over time in order to save a minute today. Don’t sacrifice hours to save a minute.

The fourth, and one of the biggest steps towards increased efficiency, is to improve your management of communications. Communications are one of the biggest ways you can lose time, for completely unproductive purposes, while feeling like you’re getting work done. Let’s look at the need to completely avoid real time communications and to better manage email.

One of the biggest problems in many tech companies (and businesses in general for that matter) is the use of real time messaging platforms such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts, and others.

The problem with these platforms is twofold. First, they result in people sending a large number of small messages as opposed to requiring that they put all of their thoughts into one message. This means that the reader of these short messages has work in a constant state of distraction. The individual gets far less done as a result.

Second, and perhaps worse, is the fact that these platforms lead to co-workers/employees/partners sharing random thoughts that don’t really have anything to do with the project at hand as well as the sharing of messages essentially saying how much one liked the last message.

These types of interruptions contain no actionable information and, instead, just lead to the reader being bombarded by extra noise. It is far more efficient to read one comprehensive message, which is why we avoid these types of platforms.

Many developers could also improve how they manage email. It is a mistake to read emails as soon as they come in. Instead, you should completely deal with your email inbox during one to two set times per day, and avoid it for the rest of the time.

There are several reasons for this. First, as stated above, you shouldn’t read an email unless you are prepared to act on it. Second, it is important to consider how people tend to use email. Way too many people fire off a message as soon as a thought enters their head.

It’s not uncommon for me to open my inbox in the afternoon and have multiple emails from the same customer. By waiting to deal with emails until a set time, I can then read all of their emails and write one consolidated response. This is opposed to writing separate responses, which would take more time.

Also, you  _actually create more email_ for yourself to read if you respond to messages immediately. Suppose Joe Client sends you a random thought and you respond. Now suppose that Joe does this several more times, and you respond, during the day. Joe is likely to respond back to each of your responses (creating a large number of emails to read). By writing Joe a consolidated response, at a set time of the day, Joe will only have one email from you to respond to. The net result is far fewer messages hitting your inbox. This saves a great deal of time.

After reading the prior paragraph on email management, you may be saying to yourself “but my clients want to hear from me right away.” If you go through your inbox at least once a day, then they’re never going more than about 24 hours without a response.

If something is so important that someone can’t wait 24 hours for a response then they should be calling you on the phone as opposed to shooting you an email.

I never go through my email more than twice a day and our customers feel that we give good service. Save yourself time and only respond to emails during set time blocks each day.

When you put all of the above-mentioned concepts together you will greatly improve your efficiency.

By using the O.H.I.O method you will reduce the amount of time you spend reading email, reviewing documents, and so on.

Only starting projects when you are prepared to finish them, and working on one thing at a time, reduces distractions and allows you to stay in a groove.

Dealing with problems as soon as they arise will result in you losing minutes today, but saving hours over time.

Finally by improving/reducing your communications, you will avoid distractions and actually have fewer messages to respond to. Put these things together with actually putting in the hours and you can look like this happy person:

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/person-with-money.jpg)

  
Suppose the foregoing efficiency tips make you twenty percent more efficient than the average developer. Also, suppose you average a minimum of 43.3 hours worked per week (the reason why I use this number was explained above). Finally, suppose your competitors average forty hours a week at average efficiency.

You will achieve in one year what it takes your competitors roughly 15.5 months to achieve. If you focus all of this production on high value activities, then your bank account will grow quickly.

### Action items for freelance developers who wish to better manage their business on a day to day basis

Freelance developers can greatly increase their net income by better managing all aspects of their day-to-day operations. The following is a list of “action items” which can help you to immediately increase profits:

-   Properly manage your financial and administrative affairs.

-   Read Profit First and adopt its suggested financial plan for your business. Alternatively, develop your own financial plan and stick to it. Sign up for accounting/bookkeeping software and get in the habit of doing your books regularly.
-   Research and learn about administrative requirements you must meet (i.e. filing for a business license). This will vary by state and locale. Your local Secretary of State’s Office may be able to assist with this information.

-   Manage your development work in an efficient manner and identify your “high value” work opportunities.

-   This is the work that pays the most per hour of labor, not necessarily the most in total.
-   Make a plan to focus your business on these high value activities and maintain a narrow focus in regards to the type of work you take.

-   Decide on a minimum number of hours that you will commit to the business each week. Make sure you hit this hour requirement on a weekly basis.
-   Adopt the Only Handle It Once (O.H.I.O.) method.
-   Adopt the habit of not starting on something until you are prepared to finish it.
-   Adopt the habit of dealing with problems as soon as they arise.
-   Improve your management of communications.

-   Avoid “real-time” communication platforms such as Slack or Microsoft Teams.
-   Set aside time each day in which you will deal with email. Do not deal with email outside of these designated time periods.

## Conclusion

In no way is this guide meant to tell you every last thing you need to know about running your own business. Sticking with these tips, however, will help you to get out ahead of your competition.

Keep in mind that being successful in business requires effort in  **all**  of the areas described above. You’re never going to be better than the area you are weakest in. Because of this, I can't stress enough that you need need to be striving for constant improvement in all aspects of your business.
