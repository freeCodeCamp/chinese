Hey everyone! 👋

过去的2020年是艰难的一年。

新冠病毒的疫情越来越严重，很多人被感染、正在治疗中、丧失亲人朋友、丢掉工作、或者眼看着自己的生意失败了。

在这样的时刻，我们会面临从未想象过的考验，也会有成长的机会。

让我分享一个关于学习编程的类似“时刻”，一个对我来说很有意义的故事给你。

## 作为土建工程师的我

2015年一月，为了一个新项目，我在安哥拉坐车从万博去库巴尔。工程的内容是：建设100公里长的道路，直接连通两个遥远的城市（库巴尔和雄戈罗伊）

坐在我旁边的是一位经验丰富的混泥土工程师，Pedro。作为副驾驶员的他既是我的朋友，也是一名极其专业的工程师，有他在，所有的建筑问题都能解决。而作为高级土建工程师的我，主要负责在政府与承建方之间协调，管理项目进度。

两个葡萄牙人驾车驶出万博城区，来到一个荒无人烟的地方，停在铁轨和公路的交叉口，等待火车过去。

汽车收音机正播放着非洲的流行歌曲，我突然和他说：

> “新的一年开始了，又是一月份，我的生活简直是一塌糊涂。我的那段感情没了，钱也没了，大女儿也跟我很疏远，总之，我很反感这份工作”。

为了减少GFC（2007-2008年的全球金融危机）和后续的葡萄牙经济危机对我们的影响，我们不得不努力工作。金融危机导致建筑行业市场大萧条，而到了2015年，我们又陷入了安哥拉的石油危机。

后面我才意识到我生活巨变的开端。

我们住在库巴尔的一个小镇，这里之前是前殖民地，也被1975年-2002的独立战争和内战严重摧毁过。在这个地方，除了白天工作，晚上喝酒，就是在猴面包树林里瞎晃悠。

处理这个项目的同时，我还要安排其他的项目合同，使得我经常要开很远的车，几乎达到1万公里每个月：从这个海岸到另一端的海岸，从本格拉的海滩到Kuito Kuanavale，一个靠近赞比亚西部边疆的非洲中部城市。

这是一段宝贵的时光，他开启了我改变现状的欲望。随着时间流逝，这种欲望在Pedro和我的脑袋开始联结，想要自我改变的欲望越来越强烈。

## 为什么要改变自我

我的改变从利用自己的时间刺激大脑开始，因此我开始在电脑上阅读、看电影、为永远改变自己的生过设计宏伟的计划。

4月份，我回到葡萄牙，并且和生活了13年的妻子离婚了。很快，我又回到安哥拉工作。

但我仍在保持进步，通过大量的运动来保持生活健康。

不久后，我遇到了我未来的妻子，她是库巴尔的一名银行会计。我们第一次约会比我想象的还要快。

我通过阅读、查阅大量知识，以达到继续提高自我的目的。随后，生活的进展发生新的变化了。

一年后，也就是2016年9月，生活突然变得很糟糕。经济石油危机日益增强，导致石油价格暴跌到低于40美元一桶。而Kwanza（安哥拉的货币）兑换美元汇率大约下跌到通常情况的五分之一。

工资被拖欠，手上的钱也用得差不多了。那个时候，除了我的第一个孩子Maria，我还有新的伴侣Benvinda（现在是我的妻子），我的继女Teresa，我们小宝宝Benedita需要照顾。

我不得不在生活上有所调整，而我的妻子也有失业危险，因为银行每天都在关闭分支机构。钱无法从安哥拉转到葡萄牙，因为Kwanza下跌太快，现在是一种封闭的货币，也就是无法在安哥拉之外交易。

2016年圣诞节的时候，我去了葡萄牙。

我疲于想尽各种办法去改善我的现状。我坐在电脑前，尝试通过建立一个小网站来帮助管理我的团队和在安哥拉的工作花费。

我一直喜欢电脑，以前也学过一些HTML，CSS，LAMP技术。即使很难学，我也相信我能够学更多，并且，这种学习能让我忘记当时糟糕的处境和贫穷。

很快我就发现仅凭已有的编程知识无法满足我的需要，因此，我把编程当做一个爱好去一点点的学，试着去解决工作中遇到的每一个问题。

我找到了一些网站和辅导资料，却陷入了困惑，因为我不知道从哪开始学，MySQL？ PHP？还是Ruby on Rails？

## Finding freeCodeCamp

In early 2017 I discovered freeCodeCamp and started to investigate it immediately ([here][1]). I read a lot about what people were doing with freeCodeCamp, about career change, programming, job interviews and salaries. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This could be a solution to my job situation.

On the 3rd of January I started going through the freeCodeCamp curriculum with all the strength I had.

At that time, I found Alex Kallaway's #100DaysOfCode very motivational and I immediately felt that I'd need that kind of energy in my life.

Through the freeCodeCamp community I quickly met João Henrique, who was also starting freeCodeCamp "just for fun". João lived near me (60km) and soon we became study partners and started to support each other. Without him it would have been much harder to stand up.

Together we started our first freeCodeCamp local meet up (freeCodeCamp Algarve was born)! We didn't know at the beginning, and it was only us. Soon-ish we'd be gathering 10-20 peeps to chit chat and code with us (but that's another story).

I quickly surpassed the first obstacles and reached the JavaScript section. In the meanwhile, I'd started to read a lot about programming and started grokking things very quickly.

An old passion was revived. The freeCodeCamp road map helped a lot. We just followed the proposed challenges without questioning the process.

Somehow I could see a future, a change, an improvement in my life and in the lives of my family. I kept reading posts on the freeCodeCamp forum as it was my biggest source of faith. Everyday someone was publishing a "Got my first job!" post.

I kept my job in Angola for a while. In February I returned there and explained to my wife how this could be a great change in our lives. We would be able to live in Portugal as soon as I could find a job as a programmer. Working as a Civil Engineer by day and studying by night I had reached the end of the front end certification.

The Simon Game almost killed me but I was able to do it in the end!

Thanks to Miguel Coquet (my former mentor and later first employer) who guided me through the intricacies of JavaScript's async nature I was able to do it. And it felt goooood. It was a great victory, in the middle of the night, on that construction site where I was working and living temporarily.

I had made my decision. I was going to be a programmer, no matter what.

## Life Back in Portugal

In May 2017 I left Angola and settled in my parents' house, with the few savings my wife and I had, studying night and day. I would sleep for a few hours when I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. It wasn't easy. But it was possible, and I was very passionate about what I was doing.

My wife and kids stayed in Angola for a while. It was painful. Month after month we wondered when could we be together again. That was a big lesson for us: to be patient and believe that we would soon be together and well. We didn't know when, but we believed in it with all our hearts.

When you really commit yourself to something, you can achieve it. Believing it's possible is the first main factor to achieve it and to manifest it.

In Portugal I had a lot more opportunities than in Angola. There was a local community -  [Geek Sessions][2]  \- and some kewl guys organizing events like talks and workshops (such as nodeschool).

I started to meet and get to know the community.

For the first time, I met people who lived and breathed programming - real developers - and got three great official mentors:  [Miguel Coquet][3],  [Nelson Neves][4], and  [André Jonas][5].  _Thanks once again folks, for everything you've done for me._

My learning speed increased a lot. I quickly got into Node.js and MongoDB. In a few months I was able to build a minimal full stack app (a front end, a back end and a database).

## Getting My First Developer Job

Then the  _voilà_  moment happened. freeCodeCamp supplied me all the ingredients to become an entry-level full stack dev.

In September 2017 I was hired by Miguel Coquet. I never expected it to happen so soon. He was starting to get the ball rolling with his own consultancy company and saw something in me. The vulnerability, the courage, the strength, the ability to bet all my life on the job that I so much wanted and needed.

My first job was already a remote one - with his mentoring and guidance - working for a mid-sized company in Amsterdam.

I couldn't believe I was making money as a programmer. I was SURVIVING!!

Computers and programming had always been an hobby of mine, and all of a sudden I was buying food with it. It started with a very nice salary, which helped me quickly reunite with my family in Portugal.

Just before Summer 2018 my wife, kids, and I were all together just in time to celebrate Benedita's second birthday in Portugal.

## Life as a Developer

Since those days I've kept studying and reading at a fast pace. Being a programmer makes you a lifelong learner, and that is one of the greatest hidden values of doing freeCodeCamp.

You quickly learn to be autonomous. But it also provides you all the support you need from its community. The general rule of thumb is to "Read, Search, Ask".

Nowadays I work as a remote frontend developer for a Swedish company - developing an agile remote collaboration and production solution for broadcasters. I make more money than 95% of the people in Portugal do, all without leaving home.

If you told me this in 2015, I wouldn't have believed it was possible. Five years have passed, and that's a lot of time. But things happen faster than you think.

My career reboot was very fast (8 months, 3 of which I worked during the day). If only I had known about freeCodeCamp before! 🙈

So...

## Take Those Next Steps

Maybe you're feeling like I was in 2015, without hope, without motivation, without strength, without faith.

If you've found this article, maybe you're searching for something but you don't know what exactly.

Maybe life is sending you a message that there's hope for you, there's a path, there's a solution.

Maybe you don't know that the right time for a change is NOW.

Just believe, put in all the effort, put in the hours, work day and night, talk to people, find a "traveling mate", find a mentor, study, grow, expose your vulnerabilities with honesty, fail, ask all the questions you have (there's no dumb questions), and make it happen. ❤️

## Why You Should Start  [freeCodeCamp][6]

These are the main advantages of freeCodeCamp as I see it:

-   It's  **completely free**. In times where you're running out of money this is very important. And believe me, paid bootcamps aren't better than freeCodeCamp. All it requires is that you put in the effort, to be the driver of your learning. In paid bootcamps you have to do exactly the same.
-   It provides a  **user-friendly**  environment for beginners, with a baby steps approach to code.
-   It provides you with a great  **road map**: you don't have to get confused about what should you learn first. If you want to work on the web, this is it.
-   It provides you with a simple rule:  **"Read, Search, Ask"**  which, if you apply it correctly, will help you get really good at searching Google for what you need. And in the end, if you're still stuck, backs you with community support. And believe me, this is the best community in which you can expect to learn how to code.
-   It provides you with  **challenging projects**. In the end what we want is to  **learn by doing**. This will make you read through the challenges carefully, investigate how to solve them, learn the technologies, and  **discuss with other students or mentors**. Through this process you'll find  **everything you need to be successful "on the job".**
-   freeCodeCamp is a  **serious thing**. Don't think that you need a certificate from an expensive paid bootcamp or university. I've done dozens of interviews and people already know freeCodeCamp. I've already been interviewed by someone who had done freeCodeCamp. Everybody knows someone who's a great developer in a kewl company that did freeCodeCamp. Moreover, companies know that you're a self-starter, a lifelong learner, someone who, in the middle of an issue, has the tools to strive and figure out those problems. And this is what companies want. People that drive their success, that come up with solutions instead of problems.

Don't think you're too old, or that your current job has nothing to do with code. I was 37 when I rebooted and brought a lot of soft skills with me. Everyone that has working experience brings a set of skills that are very useful and admired.

If you're passionate about computers, programming, the web, and nerdy stuff, you won't regret it at all.  **It will definitely change your life for the better.**

Cheers everyone, Happy New Year, and don't forget to code, code, code.
