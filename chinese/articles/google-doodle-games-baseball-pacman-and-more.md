![Google Doodle Games – Baseball, PacMan, and More](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2021/07/google-doodle-article-image.png)

The homepage for the Google Search engine is the most viewed webpage in the world. People conduct billions of searches every day.

When you land on the page, right above the search box, you'll see Google's logo. On many occassions the logo will be different and accompanied by what's called a _Doodle_.

These Doodles range from small, simple and temporary alterations to the traditional logo. But more often that not, they are very creative and artistic expressions.

They highlight world issues, major historical events, worldwide holidays, local celebrations, anniversaries and important figures' brithdays (including pioneers, artists, and scientists) along with their contributions to society.

When you click on the Doodle animation you can find more information about that specific topic and a little game or interaction sometimes sometimes accompanies the doodle.

## The First Google Doodle

The first doodle was created when Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin attended the annual Burning Man Festival in the Nevada desert in the United States on 30 August 1998.

They put a stick figure icon, resembling the Burning Man logo, behind the second "O" as an "Out Of Office" message to let users know of their absence in a fun and creative way.

Google was very young at the time – it had only been a couple of years since the search engine had been built by these two Stanford students. And this was just less than a week before it would be offically incorporated as a company.

You can also see that the logo was different, with an exclamation mark at the end.

## The Development of Google Doodles

Since then, this new idea of altering the logo when celebrating notable events was born, and the Doodles progressed.

Nearly two years later, Page and Brin asked Dennis Hwang – an intern at the time – to create a doodle in honor of Bastille Day, on July 14 2000. It was very well received and Dennis Hwang was appointed Chief Doodler.

Doodles started to appear more regularly on the homepage.

![Screenshot-2021-07-25-at-11.03.13-AM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-25-at-11.03.13-AM.png)

Since then, Google has a whole dedicated team of talented illustrators (called doodlers) responsible for the doodle that appears on Google's homepage for the entire globe.

The early doodles were fairly simple. When you hovered over the doodle, a little pop up text would appear noting what was being commemorated.

For Halloween in 2000, guest artist Lorie Loeb created the very first animated doodle. It featured two jack-o-lanterns in place of the "O"’s and a spider was dangling from the "L".

Another notable tech-related, nostalgic doodle was that of March 12 2019, where Google commemorated the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web.

![30th-anniversary-of-the-world-wide-web-4871946884874240-2xa-1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/30th-anniversary-of-the-world-wide-web-4871946884874240-2xa-1.gif)

You can view a [historical archive](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/google-doodle-games-baseball-pacman-and-more/google.com/doodles) of all the Google Doodles that have appeared on the homepage, letting you relive any Doodle and discover new ones you may not have seen already.

## The First Google Doodle Game

The doodle technology kept on improving, and on May 21st 2010 Google released its first interactive game – the first ever playable Doodle Google game.

This release celebrated the 30th anniverary of one of the most popular and classic arcade games, Pac Man, which was released in 1980.

![Screenshot-2021-07-25-at-4.57.49-PM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-25-at-4.57.49-PM.png)

It was an immense development for Google and it must have brightend many peoples' days by bringing back such a fun and addictive throwback game. It was estimated that over 1 billion people played the game in the first three days of its release.

The PacMan doodle game brings up 8-bit nostalgic memories as it uses the same graphics, and the same original colors, sounds, and iconic characters. It even incudes the same original game logic and bugs (!).

If you want to take a trip down memory lane, or be introduced to the game for the first time, you can play it [here](https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man).

Just press "Insert Coin" and use the arrow keys on your keyboard. You are a yellow hero aiming to eat all the dots without getting caught by ghosts of different colors.

Be prepared to spend one too many hours on this one.

## How to Play Doodle Google Games

Since then there have been many more fun and interactive games and puzzles.

The doodles and games usually stay up for one day to commemorate a specific event. But Google archives all its old doodles and doodle games on the [dedicated archive page](https://www.google.com/doodles?q=interactive) instead of just getting rid of them.

Thanks to this, you can play any of the games that have been featured on the search engine's homepage.

Playing them is easy and fuss free.

They are all web based and can be played on both desktop and mobile without needing to download anything or set up a console. You don't need any equipment – just a browser and an internet connection.

Click on the links to go to the page for the specific game and then click to start the game.

In most cases you'll use your mouse or trackpad and keyboard. If you're playing from a mobile you'll be swipping or tapping.
