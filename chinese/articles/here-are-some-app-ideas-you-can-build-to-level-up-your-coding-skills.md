![Here are some app ideas you can build to level up your coding skills](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*v3qXmKe1LTiiW_3H.png)

Have you ever wanted to build something but you had no idea what to do? Just as authors sometimes have “writer's block” it’s also true for developers.

Together with my friend [Jim][1] we created a [collection of application ideas][2] which is intended to solve this issue once and for all! ?

These applications are:

-   great to improve your coding skills
-   great to experiment with new technologies
-   great to be added in your portfolio to impress your next employer/client
-   great to be used as examples in tutorials (articles or videos)
-   easy to complete and also easily extendable with new features

This is not just a simple list of projects, but a collection that describes each project in enough detail so you can develop it from the ground up!

Each project specification contains the following:

1.  A clear and descriptive objective
2.  A list of _User Stories_ which should be implemented (these stories act more as a guideline than a forced list of _To-Do’s_. Feel free to add your own features if you want)
3.  A list of _bonus features_ that improve not only the base project but also your skills at the same time
4.  All the resources and links to help you find what you need to complete the project

### Projects

All of the projects are divided into three tiers based on the knowledge and experience required to complete them. These tiers are:

1.  **Beginner** — Developers in the early stages of their learning journey. Those who are typically focused on creating user-facing applications.
2.  **Intermediate** — Developers at an intermediate stage of learning and experience. They are comfortable in UI/UX, using development tools, and building apps that use API services.
3.  **Advanced** — Developers who have all of the above, and are learning more advanced techniques like implementing BackEnd applications and Database services.

Below you’ll find **5 projects** for each of the tiers (**15 in total**), but there are over **30 projects** (at the moment) in [this GitHub repository][3]. Make sure you check it out as we are planning to add more projects in the future. You are welcome to help! (More about this in the _Contributing_ section below ?)

### 9\. String Art

**Tier:** 2 — Intermediate

**Description**: The purpose of String Art is to provide the developer with practice creating a simple animated graphic, using geometry in the animation algorithm, and creating something that’s visually pleasant to watch.

String Art draws a single multicolored line which smoothly moves until one end touches a side of the enclosing window. At the point, it touches a “bounce” effect is applied to change its direction.

A ripple effect is created by only retaining 10–20 images of the line as it moves. Older images are progressively faded until they disappear.

Animation libraries are not allowed. Use only Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

#### User Stories

-   Start by drawing a multicolored line at a random position within the boundary of it’s enclosing window
-   Each 20 ms draw a new copy of the line at a new position based on a trajectory — the incremental distance from the previous line based on the endpoints
-   When either endpoint of the line touches the boundary of the enclosing window change it’s direction and randomly alter its angle
-   Progressively fade the intensity of old lines so that only the most recent 10–20 lines are visible to create the sense of movement or “ripple”

#### Bonus features

-   User can specify the length of the line and its velocity
-   User can specify the multiple lines within the window, all moving along different trajectories and velocities

#### Useful links and resources

### 11\. Battleship Game Engine

**Tier:** 3 — Advanced

**Description**: Battleship Game Engine (BGE) implements the classic turn-based board game as a package that’s separated from any presentation layer. This is a type of architectural pattern that useful in many application since it allows any number of apps to utilize the same service.

The BGE itself is invoked through a series of function calls rather than through directly coupled end-user actions. In this respect using the BGE is similar to using an API or a series of routes exposed by a web server.

This challenge requires that you develop the BGE and a very thin, text-based presentation layer for testing that’s separate from the engine itself. Due to this, the User Stories below are divided two sets — one for the BGE and one for the text-based presentation layer.

BGE is responsible for maintaining the game state.

#### User Stories

#### BGE

-   Caller can invoke a `startGame()` function to begin a 1-player game. This function will generate an 8x8 game board consisting of 3 ships having a width of one square and a length of:

1.  Destroyer: 2 squares
2.  Cruiser: 3 squares
3.  Battleship: 4 squares

`startGame()` will randomly place these ships on the board in any direction and will return an array representing ship placement.

-   Caller can invoke a `shoot()` function passing the target row and column coordinates of the targeted cell on the game board. `shoot()` will return indicators representing if the shot resulted in a hit or miss, the number of ships left (i.e. not yet sunk), the ship placement array, and updated hits and misses array.

Cells in the hits and misses array will contain a space if they have yet to be targeted, `O` if they were targeted but no part of a ship was at that location, or `X`if the cell was occupied by part of a ship.

#### Text-based Presentation Layer

-   User can see the hits and misses array displayed as a 2-dimensional character representation of the game board returned by the `startGame()` function.
-   User can be prompted to enter the coordinates of a target square on the game board.
-   User can see an updated hits and misses array display after taking a shot.
-   User can see a message after each shot indicating whether the shot resulted in a hit or miss.
-   User can see a congratulations message after the shot that sinks the last remaining ship.
-   User can be prompted to play again at the end of each game. Declining to play again stops the game.

#### Bonus features

#### BGE

-   Caller can specify the number of rows and columns in the game board as a parameter to the `startGame()` function.
-   Caller can invoke a `gameStats()` function that returns a Javascript object containing metrics for the current game. For example, the number of turns played, the current number of hits and misses, etc.
-   Caller can specify the number of players (1 or 2) when calling `startGame()`which will generate one board for each player randomly populated with ships.

`shoot()` will accept the player number the shot is being made for along with the coordinates of the shot. The data it returns will be for that player.

#### Text-based Presentation Layer

-   User can see the current game statics at any point by entering the phrase `stats`in place of target coordinates. (Note that this requires the `gameStats()`function in the BGE)
-   User can specify a two-player game is to be played, with each player alternating turns in the same terminal session (Note that this requires corresponding Bonus Features in the BGE)
-   User can see the player number in prompts associated with the inputs in each turn.
-   User can see both players board at the end of each turn.

### 15\. Survey App

**Tier:** 3 — Advanced

**Description**: Surveys are a valuable part of any developers toolbox. They are useful for getting feedback from your users on a variety of topics including application satisfaction, requirements, upcoming needs, issues, priorities, and just plain aggravations to name a few.

The Survey app gives you the opportunity to learn by developing a full-featured app that will you can add to your toolbox. It provides the ability to define a survey, allow users to respond within a predefined timeframe, and tabulate and present results.

Users of this app are divided into two distinct roles, each having different requirements:

-   _Survey Coordinators_ define and conduct surveys. This is an administrative function not available to normal users.
-   _Survey Respondents_ Complete surveys and view results. They have no administrative privileges within the app.

Commercial survey tools include distribution functionality that mass emails surveys to Survey Respondents. For simplicity, this app assumes that surveys open for responses will be accessed from the app’s web page.

#### User Stories

#### General

-   Survey Coordinators and Survey Respondents can define, conduct, and view surveys and survey results from a common website
-   Survey Coordinators can login to the app to access administrative functions, like defining a survey.

-   Survey Coordinator can define 1–5 mutually exclusive selections to each question.
-   Survey Coordinator can enter a title for the survey.
-   Survey Coordinator can click a ‘Cancel’ button to return to the home page without saving the survey.
-   Survey Coordinator can click a ‘Save’ button to save a survey.

#### Conducting a Survey

-   Survey Coordinator can open a survey by selecting a survey from a list of previously defined surveys
-   Survey Coordinators can close a survey by selecting it from a list of open surveys
-   Survey Respondent can complete a survey by selecting it from a list of open surveys
-   Survey Respondent can select responses to survey questions by clicking on a checkbox
-   Survey Respondents can see that a previously selected response will automatically be unchecked if a different response is clicked.
-   Survey Respondents can click a ‘Cancel’ button to return to the home page without submitting the survey.
-   Survey Respondents can click a ‘Submit’ button submit their responses to the survey.
-   Survey Respondents can see an error message if ‘Submit’ is clicked, but not all questions have been responded to.

#### Viewing Survey Results

-   Survey Coordinators and Survey Respondents can select the survey to display from a list of closed surveys
-   Survey Coordinators and Survey Respondents can view survey results as in tabular format showing the number of responses for each of the possible selections to the questions.

#### Bonus features
