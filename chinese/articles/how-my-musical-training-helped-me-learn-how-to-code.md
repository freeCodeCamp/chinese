学习音乐的经历如何帮助我学习编程(https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513883049090-d0b7439799bf?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fHBpYW5vfGVufDB8fHw&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000)
You might be thinking to yourself, what does music have to do with learning how to code?
你心里可能在想，音乐和学习编程有什么关系？
Well, as a professional  [oboist][1], I have noticed a lot of parallels between studying music and studying programming.
哈哈，作为一名专业的双簧管吹奏者，我发现二者存在很多共通之处。
Both require a lot of focus, discipline, and perseverance to become great.
这两件事都需要你极为专注、自律和坚持才能做好。
Here are some examples of how my musical training helps me stay focused in learning how to code.
下面我将分享一些事例来说明学习音乐的经历是如何帮助我学习编程的。
## Just Get it Done
## 做就完了

Back in college, there were times I wasn't prepared for my lessons, rehearsals, or exams.
上大学那会儿，我有好些时间在上课、排练、或是考试前都准备欠佳。
Instead of taking ownership for my lack of preparation I would make excuses like,
可我非但没有反思到是因为自己准备不够充分，反而会去找下面各种借口，
> “I was busy studying for a music theory test and that’s why I couldn’t prepare for my lesson.”
> “我之所以没有做好课前预习是因为我要忙着复习一个音乐理论的小测。”
or
又或者是，
> “I have a big audition coming up so I was busy preparing for that.”
> “我要忙着准备马上就要去参加的一个非常重要的试奏。”
No matter what excuse I had in the moment for being unprepared, my oboe professor never bought it. He always believed there was enough time in the day to practice, study, and have a little bit of a social life.
然而，不管我说出的理由有多么五花八门，我的双簧管老师却从不买账。他坚信我在一天的时间里可以兼顾练习、学习，并留点时间去社交。
So, he would often drop that famous NIKE slogan, "Just Do It."
接着，他经常会向我抛出那句耐克的知名广告语，“Just Do It”（做就完了）。
I would always get a little laugh about it, but he was making a valid point.
我总会对之哧哧一笑，但他说的话没毛病。
As a self-taught programmer, there are so many distractions around you all the time. It is very easy for thoughts to come into your head like,
对一个自学编程的人来说，你身边时时刻刻总有各种各样的干扰。你很容易就会产生如下这些念头，比如，
> “I really should do some more algorithm practice, but maybe tomorrow.”
> “我在算法上的确需要多加练习，但要不明天再练吧。”
or
或是，
> “I really should get started on that new project but I am really busy.”
> “我必须得要开始着手那个新项目了，但我真的很忙。”
Most people in life do not have 24 hours of uninterrupted free time to do whatever we want. There will always be something that comes up and we just have to deal with it.
大多数人在生活中都不会具备连续24小时不被打扰的空闲时间去做我们想做的事。总有别的事情在半路跳出来需要我们处理。
The harsh reality is that we have to stay disciplined to get our work done so we can become better programmers.
现实残酷的是，我们只有保持自律、完成我们的工作，才能成为更优秀的程序员。
So when you are about to make another excuse for procrastination remember to get it done anyway!
因此，当你再度为拖延找寻借口时，记住，无论如何也要做完手中的工作！
## Practice Makes Perfect - Or Does it?
## 熟能生巧，一定能吗？

We have all heard the saying, “Practice makes Perfect”.
我们都听过这句话，“熟能生巧”。
Well, that is not entirely true.
但是，这句话并不总是正确。
My oboe professor in college would always dismiss this phrase and instead tell us “Practice Makes Permanent”.
我的双簧管老师从来不屑这句话，而是告诉我们，“孰能生恒”。
Whenever I was trying to learn a new piece, I would get frustrated that it wasn’t getting any better. No matter how many times I practiced, it was still a mess.
每当我努力去学一支新的曲子时，我都会因为看不到进步而感到很沮丧。无论我练多少遍，都没有进展。
But I learned early on that just showing up and practicing is not enough. You have to practice smart.
但我后来才明白，只是去参加练习是远远不够的，我必须巧于练习。
So I learned how to break things down into small chunks, slow down the metronome and work on that passage until it was right.
我学会了把一只长曲切分为几个小的部分，并把节拍慢下来，把每一段练到位了才继续下一段。
Once I changed my practicing habits, I started to become a much better musician.
在我改变了练习习惯后，我逐渐成为了一名更优秀的乐师。
In learning how to code, rushing through a course is not going to make you a better programmer. In some cases, you might develop some bad habits that will be tough to break later on.
同样，在学习编程时，急于去学完一门课并不能让你成为一名更优秀的程序员。有时，你还会因而养成一些坏习惯，以致后面很难再去改正。
It is better to tackle one problem at a time and work through it slowly than rush through all of them.
与其急于解决所有问题，不如慢慢地去逐个突破。
If you practice smart, then the concepts will start to make more sense.
当你巧于练习时，就更能理解我说的这些话了。
## Consistency is Key
## 持之以恒是关键

I was one of those kids that started piano at age 7 and was really into it for the first few years.

But once I started working on harder pieces, I just lost the motivation to practice.

I was very sporadic with my practicing habits, and as a result I wasn’t getting any better. My lessons ended up being a complete waste because we were just going over the same things week after week.

With all of the hype around learning how to code at home, a lot of people dive in with an initial excitement. They will go through tutorials and build small projects from class.

But as the months go by, people start to lose motivation.

They start to code less often and eventually lose interest and quit.

In learning how to code, you have to come up with a consistent schedule or else you will never become a programmer.

You will always be stuck struggling with the fundamentals and never be able to build more complex projects.

You don’t have to put in 12 hours a day to be successful. Build a schedule that works for you.

If you only have 2 hours a day to dedicate to learning, then stick with that.

But repeating a cycle of doing 8 hours one day and then taking two weeks off will just lead to lack of progress.

Consistency is the key to learning something well.

## Practice what you don’t know

During my junior year of college, our wind ensemble conductor told us something that has stuck with me ever since.

He said, “Have the courage to practice what you don’t know.”

Most of us wanted to practice music that we knew sounded good in the practice room. It was probably a way for us to feel good and stroke our egos a little bit.

But, my conductor was right.

If you don’t challenge yourself and work on your weaknesses then you will never grow as a musician.

There is so much to learn when you are just starting out as a beginner programmer. It is really tempting to only focus on the things you enjoy.

It makes sense that you want to feel good about yourself and show off what you know. But that doesn’t give you the excuse to ignore what you are bad at.

If you know you are bad at algorithms, don’t ignore them. Make extra time to work on them so they become easier to solve.

Or maybe you are struggling with recursion. It is not going to go away just because you don’t like it.

Even though it is difficult in the moment, you have to have the discipline to sit down and learn what you need to learn.
