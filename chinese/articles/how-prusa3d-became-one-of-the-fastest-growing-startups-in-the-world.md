![How a Czech DJ Built a 3D Printing Empire](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2021/03/Josef-Prusa_Prusa-Research_005--1-.jpg)

In 2012, a young Czech DJ hobbyist was frustrated with the knobs and faders on his music controllers, so went looking for ways to improve them. That’s when he came across 3D printing, and one of the fastest-growing 3D printing companies in the world was born.  

Today, I’m going to show you exactly how Prusa3D became one of the fastest-growing hardware manufacturers in Europe. Then you can take inspiration from their exact strategy to grow a hardware company and create a community of contributors who will help you develop and promote your project with close to no resources.

## Some background on Prusa

Josef Prusa, Prusa Research’s founder, is a superstar in the 3D printers industry.

You might have already heard about him but if you haven’t……

-   Prusa Research was founded as a one-man startup in 2012 by Josef Prusa.
-   His goal with Prusa Research was to create a kind of Thermomix, Europe's favourite all-in-one, easy-to-use kitchen appliance, for 3D printing. He wanted to make a 3D printer that was easy enough that anyone could use it, with guidance on steps and materials.
-   In 2018 Prusa Research became the fastest-growing tech company in Central Europe (Deloitte Fast 50 2018) after growing [17,118%](https://www2.deloitte.com/cz/en/pages/press/articles/technology-fast-500-emea-v-top-petce-hned-dve-ceske-firmy.html) between 2014 and 2018
-   Prusa Research has grown from humble beginnings to selling 100,000 printers, employing over 410 employees, and setting up a factory in Prague with 9 floors and a hackerspace on the ground floor
-   The company brought the Maker Faire to Prague for the first time
-   Prusa’s website has over one million unique visitors per month, its YouTube Channel has more than 144,000 subscribers, and its forum has over 143,000 members

Josef Prusa was lucky, but also did a lot of things well that we can all learn from.

How? Let’s dive in.

# How to solve a problem of your own, give back, and build trust in growing communities

Before the roller coaster started, Josef enrolled in an economics degree to make his parents proud. This resulted in a lot of spare time, so he and his brother began DJing and building their music controllers.

_Josef (above), rocking his DJ skills. Little did he know how his life was about to change._

He was looking to make his own knobs and faders, but found the search into it too long and challenging. He then found the RepRap project and Mendel 3D printer.  

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/E1aDCM352WrnBfNzyFNcUm5OAkmqSPXr-qk_99hlG4oX8lkTxuwb6VnrupN2LoZCW5I3Ml2uxtnMXkQGkDy384h4KIAyhWehZxCWu7djASy2Jnm3z5dtaISi93SAT5KYkKtUOny_)

As you may know, RepRap is a community project started by Doctor Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath and it kickstarted the desktop 3D printing craze.

The basic idea is that a 3D printer can print as many parts as possible for another 3D printer and as a result, decreases its cost.

But when Josef was building his Mendel Printer, he was finding it too complex. It required many different screw sizes, there were no slots for nuts, and very few parts were push-to-fit.

So he improved the Mendel by making a simpler version; the Simplified Mendel \[sic\], and shared the designs on GitHub with the rest of the RepRap community.

The community caught up with his simplified model and started using it over the original, and that’s when people started noticing him.

Takeaways:

-   If you’re a student, have spare time, and/or have no dependents, enjoy this time to experiment and try new things. What are you curious about building?
-   Identify and solve a problem of your own.  What tools are you using? What’s currently frustrating you about them?
-   Fix or simplify what’s not working. If you don’t know how, what skills would help you? Learn those.
-   Share your solution in a community that’s active and that has the same problem. You’ll benefit from exposure and feedback to make your solutions better. This way you’ll start building trust among a like-minded audience and you’ll be in touch with what people want.

# How to create your first prototype

When Josef was trying to solve his problem, printers were still missing one key component to have the ABS plastic print successful: a heated bed. Without it, prints warped and deformed away from the bed.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fB8aJ9C9S_tM_3hzz7WI5olf_HNXAbjO7Lrm3e8MCsfxIvG1TXl9i3SqjYyhNjdRVPkCuYpAKD9M4PAvXwDIiYGPobfLz2ZjdhFGYLHNjX_B26XeA2c8hh-vQb_PD_uqC8nO7Qyc)

To tackle this problem, he came up with a rudimentary prototype (shown above) which consisted of a resistance wire stuck between two sheets of acrylic. It didn’t last very long.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Rmv56o7815WM3I7Bjwb30-UVrnDle0OV5PS5RH4s2QcTwH_vv8T04sM6L8vWqWxI7o4xr6RsW-Ci7QPloP305EnqoBUpGQOxL6H7usSol4ZRkHEARj-s65dv0XNx_9zN1AUnoTlM)

Without letting the setbacks defeat him, he went on to create a second version. This one used a tile instead of acrylics, which was an improvement. But still, it only reached about 90 degrees Celsius, which wasn’t enough either.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5jgo8YFW8Ac8Ca3S-R0QVnsVRvFBsSwnZPVGPpj8ZLNy5K55DLs5qSn48txNilV9iYX2sCpAqo5YkODqUU8B8VJ4OI8EOqVMobnguJHbsbZvSJw-hsZ5AO7XV5QQK-MBgDo7U9gb)

After nearly six months of persistent work, the PCB Heatbed MK1 (above) was complete. It was the first real product he created.

This new heatbed could reach 110ºC, more than enough for ABS and other high-temperature plastics.

But many parts of the heatbed were either too expensive or difficult to get, so he redid many on his own.

He soon started receiving requests to print his Prusa Mendel’s parts. He also organized a few local build events, where everybody could build their own parts.

There was so much demand that it was time for Josef to officially start Prusa 3D with his brother Michal.

What’s interesting is that he didn’t start with the company name, the logo, and so on – rather, he started with a problem he had himself, and then he shared publicly, both his problem and his solutions, with others.

By sharing what he was doing with others, people who had the same problem could order his solution. And there were many people who shared his problem, which translated into many orders.

It’s also important to appreciate the persistence and patience it takes to continue iterating for six months in order to create a product that works and one that people want to use.

Josef and his brother began selling their first parts without an e-shop and instead sold them through email and a phone number on a webpage. They also hadn’t perfectly optimized their packaging yet. In the beginning, they packed their heatbeds in a pizza box and shipped them off to their clients.

Josef and Michal didn’t let the lack of a perfect tech solution get in their way. They simply found a way that was good enough to get their idea out the door and then made it better as they went along.

They were also proactive in creating awareness and trust with their audience. In the early days, they kickstarted the community by organizing presentations and going to events to educate people about the possibilities of this new 3D printing idea.

Josef also embodied honesty in his sales. If people came to him but were looking for something he didn’t sell or was a poor fit, he just told them which technology they should use instead.  

This earned him a community of loyal users who trusted him and regularly came back to share prints and hacks on the new Prusa Printer's online hub. Whenever Prusa was criticized in their Youtube comment section, a flock of fans spoke up in their defense.

Takeaways:

-   Start simple before having everything figured out.
-   Let go of perfectionism or trying to look like established companies. What is good enough for the stage you’re at to satisfy the needs of the people you can serve? If it’s packaging your products in a pizza box instead of providing a delightful unboxing experience, so be it. If it’s not having an e-shop but just an email and a phone number on a simple website, so be it.
-   Focus on creating a solution that solves the problem for good. It might take some time, but if it hasn’t been solved yet, there’s a good chance it’s because it’s hard to solve. Being persistent and patient requires you to commit and invest at the beginning, but once you get through the other side of the problem, you’ll have something people will flock to. It took Josef Prusa six months before he found a proper solution for his heatbed.
-   Be radically honest and defend the best interests of your customers. If there is someone else who can serve them better, redirect them there. This builds trust, as people will remember how you treated them with respect.

# Should you do everything yourself, or delegate certain tasks?

When we start something and it gets some traction, or even if we just anticipate the traction it can get, thinking about everything that we have to deal with can become overwhelming.

There might be barcode visualization, trademark registration, label design, building walls, building websites, accounting, invoicing, digging drains, dealing with bankers, installing equipment, video-editing, dealing with customer support, and more.

Most of the time we’re not even remotely competent at more than one or two of those things.

So this is the time when we hit a fork in the road. Do we hire or outsource to delegate, or do we do it ourselves?

Prusa’s beginnings are an interesting example of how to go through this period and build for the long term. Below, Josef [explains](https://www.tctmagazine.com/additive-manufacturing-3d-printing-news/pushing-prusa/) how they went about preparing to scale:

> _“We never had resellers so we were always in direct contact with the customers in the community and this proved very important for us because you have instant feedback from the people._  
>   
> _If you are just a manufacturer and somebody else is doing the selling for you, you don’t always get all the information back._  
>   
> _In the beginning, it was much tougher for us to do it this way because we not only needed to learn how to make the printers at scale but we also needed to learn how to run a big webshop and how to do the customer support for all these people. It was more difficult but now it’s paying off that we have this direct contact and know how to run every part of the business on our own.”_

It wasn’t until October 2013, three years after finishing the initial prototype, that they hired their first employee, Hanka.

How do you get the cash flow to hire people? Well, you sell in advance and produce after. In the beginning, Prusa always had a two week lead time for customers to get a printer.

As they continued to grow, they also hired a Foxconn engineer to deal with quality and a couple more software engineers to lead the engineering team.

They could have spent months or years trying to raise funding through VC or Kickstarter in order to hire people, outsource production and grow much faster.

But they decided instead to invest in the slower and more demanding path of figuring it out on their own, and keeping contact with the customers and their needs. This path has proven to be a much better strategy in the long run.  

In 2014, Prusa Research had a revenue of 149.000€, which then grew to 70 million €, employing over 250 employees in 2019 just by bootstrapping the business.

If you aim to change the system, you need to be able to exist independently of it.

Takeaways:

-   Embrace DIY and learn to do the critical parts of the business yourself. What skills do you need to learn? Where can you learn them?
-   Once you can no longer do it yourself, understand what needs to be done, and when you have enough cash flow, hire people to do the work with you.

# What Prusa stands for

Prusa has exploded because it does a few things very well by always putting their customers' needs first without compromising their values or their price. This in turn helps them build a strong virtuous cycle for their development.

### Prusa has a long-term vision

Josef knows what he wants Prusa to become. He wants his printers to be able to print any object with any material and through guided steps, much like a Thermomix for 3D printing. And he wants the least tech-savvy person to be able to operate it.

Having this clarity helps him and everyone in the company align their efforts towards a common goal.

### They have amazing customer support

The company also keeps investing in the way it cares for its customers.

They go to great lengths to test every single part of their printers to ensure quality but even that isn’t enough to cover everything – so that’s why they have support.

Almost 20% of their employees work in customer support. They have 12,000 live chats per month in nine languages and deal with over 11,000 emails each month.

### Prusa provides high quality products

Investing in making the designs of their 3D printers more functional, simple, and of high quality allows them to avoid competing with the nicer-looking but more expensive 3D printers.

### They make an affordable printer

This means that they are not too expensive for everyday consumers, and not too cheap for companies.

They’ve also made their 3D printer upgradable because it saves money for their customers and it builds their clients’ autonomy by helping them learn about the construction of the printer’s hardware.

### All Prusa's work is open source

Prusa’s clients are “normal Joes” as Josef describes them, and most don’t care much about open source. But the company does.

Those who care about open source provide valuable contributions that can be added back into the products. Some people will make improvements, some will fill in new code, and all of it helps make the printers better.

The open-source approach is also good for users. Those who want to do modifications find it much simpler because they have the original sources for the printer parts, the firmware, and the electronics.

Josef even has a tattoo of the OHSWA logo to keep himself accountable and honest to the open source vision.

Open source makes it easy for the idea to spread and upskill people who can find new use cases to increase the company’s pace of innovation, and it makes it more affordable to its clients.

### They partner with distributors and support their clients even though it decreases their margins

Another counterintuitive thing Prusa does for its clients is that it supports the customers serviced by other distributors.

Many companies would forfeit this channel because it demands high margins and the distributors don’t do support. But they do these distribution partnerships anyway to make it easier for the people they serve to discover and access their printers.

And even if they make no extra money through these channels, they still give them the same level of support as those who buy from their website.

Why? Because caring for their customers is what makes it safe for them to then recommend Prusa to their friends and family, driving more business by word of mouth.

Takeaways:

-   What is the long term vision of what you’re doing? What happens as you keep developing your organization? What results are you helping people achieve?
-   How can you invest in better supporting your customers?
-   What parts of your project can you give away for people to build and learn with you?
-   What partnerships can you build to distribute your project in places where people need it?

# How Prusa Builds and Invests in the Community

We’ve already spoken a lot about how much they invest in customer support, but Prusa also invests heavily in their community.

This does two things: it builds proof of what their product does in the world, and it helps scale even further what their customer support service can do.

To gather their community they do a few things.

The first thing Prusa does is offer two options to customers: They can either buy printers as kits or assembled. 80% of clients buy the printers in kits. Besides saving time in production, this allows the clients to learn how to build their printers and understand how they work.

This approach is raising a generation of makers who can create and fix instead of throw away, building a lot of goodwill for the Prusa brand.

To keep in touch with the community, in the early days Josef Prusa tried to go to as many shows as possible so that he could talk to fans face to face and hear about the awesome projects that could come to life with the help of their printers. He went to Maker Faires and to DIY or 3D-printing events.

Now that the company has grown so much, he can’t go to as many events. But before the pandemic started, there was a team of three to ten people traveling around the world two to four times a month. And they were also organizing their Maker Faire in the Czech Republic.

Takeaways:

-   Where are your community members hanging out? What blogs or magazines do they read? What podcasts do they listen to? What events do they go to? What youtube channels do they watch? What newsletters do they subscribe to? Who do they follow on Twitter, Facebook, or Linkedin? What forums or groups do they participate in?
-   What resources do they need to get started that you can facilitate? How can you give them the tools to create what you do?
-   How can you invite users to participate in the development of your product? Can you open your files and designs for them? How can you invite them to give back and showcase their work or the skills they’re building thanks to you? Where could you use this as proof that your product works?

# How to Engage the Community

Many people understand the value of giving free stuff away online to attract a crowd. But I feel that many entrepreneurs haven’t embraced the opportunity and the value of connecting the people in their community with each other.

This is a very powerful idea that can go a long way in building trust and reciprocity with your brand and in getting the community members to spread the word and interact with stories of what you do.

One more powerful thing that Prusa is doing is figuring out how to connect the isolated Maker tribe, and at scale.

Once they gather their community by giving away their designs and connecting with them at events, the next challenge is getting these people to engage. And Prusa does a remarkable job at that.

They’ve created a series of resources that make it easy for people to learn the skills and tools they need to become active members of the community.

In their online hub, they share resources for learning and practice, such as a library of 3D printing models with files, and free guides on how to start 3D printing.

Once people are on their website to grab these resources, they can connect with each other locally or online through a map or in the forums to reach out for support or to go for a beer.

As a quick overview, Prusa provides the resources needed to learn the tools and the skills required to set up and hack a 3D printer. There are manuals, such as a free ebook to teach the basics of 3D printing, assembly instructions in video and ebook form, troubleshooting guides, and of course the downloadable drivers and firmware.

Once people have what they need to learn the basics, they can jump into the Forum to talk about their printer model, stay up to date with General Announcements and releases, find those community members in the Hall of Fame, and discuss the software.

Takeaways:

-   What resources does your audience need to develop the skills required to use your product and to participate in the community in order to help each other?
-   Once they trust you, how can you connect them to find support among their peers? What exchanges can you facilitate or what spaces can you create for them to gather and talk about their questions?

# In Summary

Prusa’s approach helped them grow over 17,000% without a sales team, only through word of mouth.

It helps that they serve the fast-growing 3D printing market, but still.

Prusa has become a big player and a beloved brand in their industry, proving that  you don’t need a huge marketing team or budget to get similar results. You just need a smart and intentional plan.

Here are the key takeaways you can borrow, modify, and adapt for your own business based on Prusa’s real-life marketing tactics:

### Takeaway #1: Build a skill to solve a problem of your own

What tool are you using that is not working as you wish it did? Learn the skills to fix or simplify what’s not working.

### Takeaway #2: Share your solution in public

Once you create your first working solution, share it with communities who already use these tools and have the same problem as you do.

This builds trust, reciprocity, and if people want to buy your solution or they have other problems you can build on, they can tell you.

### Takeaway #3: If it’s your first time, be patient

When we first start, we don’t have all the skills we need to find a solution to a problem. Be patient and persistent and embrace failure and rejection. It’s by getting into action that you’ll figure out what’s not working or missing, and what needs adjusting.

### Takeaway #4: Start simple, even if you don’t have everything figured out

Let go of perfectionism or trying to look like an established company. What is good enough at the stage you’re at to satisfy the needs of the people you can serve? What is good enough for now to solve other people's problems, build your product, and ship it?

### Takeaway #5: Learn to do everything yourself and become autonomous

Don’t delegate too soon. If your goal is to change the system, you’ll have to learn to be autonomous early on and stay in close contact with your customers.

When the time comes to delegate, you’ll know what needs to be done and hire the right people for it.

### Takeaway #6: Be radically honest and defend the interests of your customers

If there is a competitor who can serve them better, redirect them there. It will build trust as people will remember how you treated them with respect.

### Takeaway #7: Be clear on what you stand for

What is the long term vision of your project? If money and growth is a means to an end, what is that end meant to achieve? What can you do to accelerate or scale this?

For Prusa, it was investing in outstanding customer support and sharing their work in open source to create both a delightful experience and to involve outside experts in their innovation.

### Takeaway #8: Find and gather your community

Go meet your community where they hang out to stay in touch with their needs and to connect with them. What forums or groups do they participate in? What events do they go to?

Once you’ve found them, create spaces for them to gather and connect. Josef Prusa started by participating in the RepRap forums and by going to Maker events. Later on, they started organizing their Maker Faire in the Czech Republic.

### Takeaway #9: Engage the community

Give them the resources and tools they need to get started. Then invite them to participate in the development of your product by opening your designs.

For those who contribute, you can showcase their work and skills to show your gratitude, and use these contributions also as proof that your product and community work.
