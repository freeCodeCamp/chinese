![How to Center a Div with CSS – 10 Different Ways](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2022/07/Group-49.png)

As a web developer, sometimes **centering a div** feels like one of the toughest jobs on planet Earth.

Well, not anymore. In this article, you'll learn 10 different ways to center a `div`. We will explore how to center divs using the CSS **position** property, CSS **Flexbox**, and CSS **Grid**.

After reading this whole article, I am confident that you will start centering `divs` like a pro.

## How to Center a `Div`

For this tutorial, I will be using the same HTML for all 10 methods that we'll discuss below. The HTML just contains a parent `div` and a child `div` inside it.

The main aim of this article is to center the inner `div` with respect to its parent. I will only be changing the CSS files, but you'll be able to see all 10 different methods take effect.

The main HTML file goes like this:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Centering divs</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./basicStyle.css" />
    <!-- Change the link of CSS file here -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="" />
    <style>
      * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        margin: 0px;
        padding: 0px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="parentContainer">
      <div id="childContainer"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

With just the basic styling as given in the following lines:

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  width: 400px;
  height: 400px;
  background-color: #f55353;
}
#childContainer {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #feb139;
}
```

We will get something like this:

What the basic HTML and CSS styling gives us.

We just make a parent `div` and give it a `width` and `height` of `400px`, and a `color` of `#f55353`.

Similarly we create a child `div` inside it and give it a `width` and `height` of `100px` and give it a `color` of `#feb139`.

The final goal of this article will be to make this transformation:

![Group-23](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/Group-23.png)

## How to Center a Div using the CSS `position` Property

### 1\. How to use position: relative, absolute and top, left offset values

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  position: relative;
}
#childContainer {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

The **position** property in CSS sets how the element is positioned on the page. The default value of the position property is `static`. The other values that the position property takes are `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed` and `sticky`.

Now when we give a `position: absolute` to a DOM element, it **becomes absolute with respect to the whole page**. This would be useful if we wanted to center the `div` with respect to the whole page.

On the other hand, setting the parent element to `position: relative`, makes the children element (with `position: absolute`) **absolute, relative to the parent element and not the whole page**.

In the above example we do just that. We give the parent element a `position: relative` and child a `position: absolute`.

Along with the position property, we can specify four other properties viz. `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` which then determines the final location/ position of the element.

The `top` and `bottom` specify the **vertical positioning** of the element where as `left` and `right` specify the **horizontal positioning**.

### 2\. How to use position: relative and absolute, top, left, right and bottom offset values and margin: auto

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  position: relative;
}
#childContainer {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  margin: auto;
}
```

Continuing with our knowledge of positions from point 1 above, we use the `margin` property in CSS here. `margin: auto` lets the browser select a **suitable margin** for the child element.

In most of the cases it allows the child element to take its specified width and the browser **distributes the remaining space equally** between the left and right margin pair or top and bottom margin pair or amongst both pairs.

If we mention only `top: 0`, `bottom: 0` and `margin: auto`, it centers the child element **vertically**.

Similarly if we mention only `left: 0`, `right: 0` and `margin: auto`, then it will center the child **horizontally**.

And if we mention all the properties as shown in the code block above, then we get a perfectly **centered div both horizontally and vertically**.

## How to Center a Div Using CSS Flexbox

### 3\. How to use Flexbox, justify-content, and align-item

The above two methods are based on more of a classical method of aligning elements in the page. The modern approaches makes use of **Flexbox** (for one directional layout modeling) and **Grid** layout (for more complex two dimensional layout modeling) properties.

Let's see the Flexbox approach:

Flexbox is not just a single property, but it is a module which comprises of a set of properties. Some of these properties are meant to be for the **container** (that is, the parent container) and some for the **child elements** inside it.

The below diagram shows a list of properties that are meant for parent and child elements with respect to Flexbox.  
![Group-42](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/07/Group-42.png)

Now it is not possible to cover all the properties in this article. Rather let's look into some of the properties we are using in this article.

As mentioned above, there are two different entities in the Flexbox model, the parent container and the children element.

The `display: flex` property defines a container as a flex container. `flex-direction` is another parent container property which can take in either of the four values `row` (default value), `row-reverse`, `column` and `column-reverse`.

When working with Flexbox, we need to take two different axes into consideration, that is the **main axis** and **cross axis**.

For the cases where `flex-direction` is `row` or `row-reverse`, the **horizontal axis is the main axis and vertical axis is the cross axis**.

Similarly, when the `flex-direction` is `column` or `column-reverse`, then the **vertical axis is the main axis and horizontal axis is the cross axis.** Refer to the below diagrams for visual clarity:

![Group-43](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/07/Group-43.png)

![Group-44](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/07/Group-44.png)

The `justify-content` property of the parent container defines the alignment of its children along the main axis. Thus `justify-content: center` sets the alignment of all its child elements at the center with respect to the main axis.

Similarly, the `align-items` property of the parent container defines the alignment of its children along the cross axis. Thus `align-items: center` sets the alignment of all its child elements at the center with respect to the cross axis.

So the below code block will perfectly align our child element at the center of the parent element both vertically and horizontally.

In this method, we do not need to specify anything explicitly for the child element. `display: flex`, `justify-content` and `align-items` handle everything from the parent component.

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### 4\. How to Use Flexbox, justify-content, and align-self

This method is just an alternative to the above method and is quite similar to it.

But in place of using the `align-items` property (in the parent container property), which sets the alignment for **all the childern** elements with respect to cross axis, we use `align-self` (in the child elements) which sets the alignment of **individual flex items** on the cross axis.

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
#childContainer {
  align-self: center;
}
```

### 5\. How to Use Flexbox and margin: auto

Flexbox gives us very powerful alignment and space distribution capabilities. Also as mentioned above, `margin: auto` lets the browser select a suitable margin for the child element.

In most cases it allows the child element to take its specified width and the browser distributes the remaining space equally between the left and right margin pair or top and bottom margin pair or amongst both the pairs.

This means that setting the parent container as `flex` and giving the child a `margin: auto` alows the browser to evenly distribute the leftover space along both the vertical and horizontal directions.

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  display: flex;
}
#childContainer {
  margin: auto;
}
```

## How to Center a Div Using CSS Grid

### 6\. How to Use Grid, justify-content, and align-items

CSS Grid or just Grid is used for **two dimensional** layout modeling compared to Flexbox which you use for **one dimensional** modeling.

Similar to Flexbox, we have the concept of a grid container or parent container and grid items or children items.

The below diagram lists down all the properties you can use for the parent and children. As CSS Grid is a huge topic in itself, it's not in the scope of this article to discuss about each and every property. So let's discuss the properties that we're using in this article.

![Group-45](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/07/Group-45.png)

`display: grid` initiates an element to become a grid container.

`justify-items` and `align-items` align the items inside the grid along the inline (row) axis and block (column) axis respectively.

On the other hand, if the total size of the grid is less than the grid container (which can happen if all the grid items are sized with non-flexible units like px), then in that case we can control the alignment of the grid within the grid container using `justify-content` and `align-content`.

`justify-content` and `align-content` aligns the grid along the inline (row) axis and block (column) axis respectively.

You can find a comprehensive explanation of all these properties here: [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

As for our case there is only one **grid cell** and only one child element inside it, so we can use `justify-content` or `justify-items` as well as `align-content` or `align-items` interchangeably and get the same result.

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  display: grid;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### 7\. How to Use Grid and place-items

You can use `place-items` to set both `align-items` and `justify-items` properties in the same declaration. Similarly `place-content` sets both `justify-content` and `align-content` is the same declaration.

As mentioned above, in this use case we can use `justify-content` or `justify-items` as well as `align-content` or `align-items` interchangeably. In the same way we can also use `place-items` as well as `place-content` interchangeably and get the same result (specifically for this use case. For any other use case we need to analyse which property should be used).

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### 8\. How to Use Grid, align-self, and justify-self

Similar to Flexbox, Grid also supports individual grid item alignment using the `align-self` and `justify-self` properties (properties to be specified in the children element).

`justify-self` aligns grid items inside a grid cell along the inline (row) axis whereas `align-self` aligns the grid items inside the grid cell along the block (column) axis.

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  display: grid;
}
#childContainer {
  align-self: center;
  justify-self: center;
}
```

### 9\. How to Use Grid and place-self

The `place-self` property sets both `justify-self` and `align-self` properties in a single declaration. So assigning a child element to `place-self: center` centers the child both vertically and horizontally.

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  display: grid;
}
#childContainer {
  place-self: center;
}
```

### 10\. How to Use Grid and margin: auto

Similar to Flexbox, Grid also gives us powerful alignment and space distribution capabilities.

As seen in point 5, we can do a similar process with Grid instead of using Flexbox and we'll get the same result if we asign `margin: auto` to the child element.

```CSS
#parentContainer {
  display: grid;
}
#childContainer {
  margin: auto;
}
```

## Here's The Result

Well as expected, following any of the above methods will result in this:
