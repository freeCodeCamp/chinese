参与开源项目听起来令人望而却步。特别是如果你以前没有参与过类似项目，或者习惯于从事文档工作而非编码工作。

本指南将帮助技术文档工程师开始为开源项目做出贡献，并概述你开始贡献时可能遇到的常见陷阱。

它还将突出一些参与开源的好处，并提供一些额外的资源，帮助技术文档工程师开始为开源做出贡献。

## 你能学到什么？

本文将介绍技术文档工程师如何为开源项目做出贡献、做出贡献的好处以及一些潜在的缺点。我们还将介绍一些入门级的开源项目资源。

## 什么是开源？

开源是一种协作开发和分发软件的方式。世界各地的人们通过添加功能、修复错误、回答问题、翻译文本或编写教程等方式为开源项目做出贡献。

## 为什么要为开源项目做贡献？

Contributing to open-source software is one of the best ways for technical writers and other knowledge workers to give back and make a difference.

You can help improve the software you use every day, or you can learn from the example of others who have contributed before you. Plus, it's a great way to meet people with common interests. And when your contributions are appreciated, you'll feel like part of the community.

You might be wondering – when should you contribute? Well, if you're new to open source, contribute at your own pace—don't worry about trying to do too much too soon. You'll find what you're comfortable with.

Contributing to open-source will not only increase your skill set but also allow you to develop contacts within the community and even create opportunities for freelance work.

It takes some time to build up the knowledge and skills necessary to become an active contributor (especially because documentation often requires a different skill set than programming), but it’s worth the investment.

## 开源贡献中的挑战

Technical writers can face several challenges when they start contributing to open-source projects. One of the most common is not being sure how best to contribute, especially if you don't know anything about the project yet.

You might also be unsure about where your work should go or what is expected from contributors. There are a couple of ways around this problem: you can read the project's `README` file and/or documentation to see if they have contribution guidelines. You can also get in touch with the team behind the project and ask for help.

## 如何为开源项目做贡献？

First, you'll want to find a project on [GitHub](https://github.com/) you want to contribute to. You can [read this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/github-search-tips/) about how to search GitHub and find projects.

Next, you'll want to open the README and make sure you understand the given instructions.

Then, fork the repo by clicking on Fork located at the top right corner of your screen.

Clone the forked repo in your local computer using the following command:

```bash
git clone <LINK TO THE REPO>
```

You'll see the repo link when you click on the code dropdown.

Once you've cloned it, open up the directory containing your new fork and start adding your contribution.

When done push your changes on GitHub by using the following instructions:

```bash
git status //displays which modifications have been staged.
git add . // adds changes to the cloned repo
git commit -m "changes" //performs a commit to the cloned repo
git branch -M changes //creates a new branch
git push -u origin changes //pushes the changes
```

You will be prompted by GitHub to create a pull request after pushing your changes to the cloned repo. Go ahead and create the pull request and wait for the maintainers to merge your cloned repo to the main repo.

**Make sure to incorporate upstream modifications into your local repository** if you forked the project a while ago.

If you encounter a large file, install `git-lfs` if it is not already installed with the following command:`brew install git-lfs`

By downloading the appropriate versions of huge files slowly, the Git LFS (Large File Storage) extension, created by Atlassian, GitHub, and a few other open-source contributors, lessens the impact of large files in your repository

You can also use the following [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) to install `git-lfs`.

### 开源贡献中的最佳实践

1.  Identify an area where you could be of assistance and find the relevant project on GitHub.
2.  Read the documentation for any projects or programs that may be similar to the one you're interested in. This will give you a better understanding of what is involved in contributing and what other people have contributed.
3.  Search for issues labeled good first issue and read through them – these are typically fairly easy to solve.
4.  Get your code ready by following the contribution guidelines of the project.
5.  Write up a pull request with your solution and explain why it solves the problem at hand. Include links to related resources like tutorials if necessary.
6.  Submit your pull request for review. The team will discuss whether it should be accepted into the repository and update you about their decision.
7.  If they decide not to accept your pull request ask them how you might go about addressing their concerns so that they'll reconsider acceptance at a later date.
8.  If they do accept your pull request then thank them!
9.  Continue searching for new problems to solve and share your progress along the way!

## 我能做什么样的开源贡献？

You can contribute to these projects in many ways, including submitting pull requests for bug fixes or feature additions, writing documentation about how to use the software, improving the current documentation, translating the text into another language, and fixing typos.

You should get involved by picking a project you're interested in and reading through its documentation before diving right in.

Writing for an open-source project is a great way to establish yourself as an expert in your field and position yourself for future freelance opportunities.

One thing that technical writers should always keep in mind when writing for open-source projects is that their audience is primarily developers. This means that they need more technical details than what you would find in other types of writing.

## 我可以在哪里找到开源项目？

There are a variety of places you can find open-source projects. GitHub is the most popular place for open-source projects, but there are also repositories on BitBucket, Gitlab and other sites.

If you have an idea for an open-source project that doesn't exist yet, start by putting together your plan in a `README` file. If you're not sure how to get started with contributing to an existing project, check out its documentation or read through some pull requests before submitting one of your own.
