![How to Get Ready for a Job in Tech – Tips for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2022/04/1.png)

几个月前，我被邀请与印度一所著名学院的一群工科学生谈话。我与他们互动，激励他们，最后告诉他们，"这个行业（职场）是什么样子的？"，"你怎样才能为它做好准备？"

在经历了 15 年以上的时间开发软件、发布产品、管理团队、客户和等待之后，我有一大堆的想法要与年轻一代分享。

幸运的是，我能够把所有的东西总结成八个高度浓缩的要点，而不会让听众感到厌烦。

我将在本文中分享这些要点，以帮助你更好地准备迎接即将到来的机遇和挑战。文章中提到的所有要点都适用于每个人，无论他们目前在该行业的经验如何。

我在本文中提到的 `行业` 一词，是指 "软件行业"，因为我的经验与此直接相关。阅读愉快。

## There are Three Types of People in the Industry

我们可以把在软件行业工作的人分为三个主要群体。

![2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/2.png)

- **跟随者**: 需要职业指导和确定路径以完成其职业目标的人。他们从已经在做所需事情的人那里寻求反馈和验证，以便在行业中成长。
- **实践者**: 这类人已经在做行业发展所需的事情。他们与最新和最伟大的事物保持 "相关"。他们定期磨练自己的 "技能"，并通过分享知识和信息帮助他们的追随者成长。这个类别的人比 "追随者" 类别的人少。
- **实践者 + 探索者?:** 这类人不仅在做事情，还在为未来创造特色。他们培养 "下一步是什么" 的愿景，并以极大的 "热情 "为之努力。他们的努力不一定要产生一些非凡的产出，但他们不断尝试。同样，这个类别的人比我们之前讨论的 "实践者" 的类别要少。

请注意，这些类别并不决定谁是行业或组织中的高级或初级。相反，这些类别存在于所有工作级别、水平和工作职能中。

另外，令人兴奋的是，根据情况、技能和背景，一个人可以在所有三个类别中发挥自己的作用。

例如，X 女士在网络开发技术方面做得很好，是一个好的实践者，解决了问题，并创造了工具来帮助未来的事情。她现在开始了她的博客之旅，广泛分享她的知识。她正在通过 `跟随` 技术博客社区中的成熟的博主学习。

那么，我们如何确保在这些类别中不断建立我们的存在，并推动成为 "实践者"和 "实践者 + 探索者" 的阶段？

## 8 Tips to Help You Advance Your Coding Career

是的，我想把我的提示总结成八个关键点来关注。你可能已经在做其中的一些或全部，或者还没有开始做这些事情。无论哪种方式都可以，我希望它能鼓励你从这里进一步加强。

## 1\. Build Habits

![4](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/4.png)

我们的 `习惯` 在我们的生活中驱动着我们。我们在不知不觉中养成了许多习惯，而我们必须有意识地养成一些。

一个好的习惯可以帮助你培养正确的态度来解决问题，处理具有挑战性的情况，并做出更好的决定。它帮助你设定合理的目标并接近它们。有好习惯的人是有组织的，有思想的，平易近人的，并且有积极的心态。

那么，有哪些好习惯呢？有很多，这里有一些基本的。

- 阅读
- 写作，做笔记
- 锻炼身体
- 设定时间表
- 有条不紊
- 省钱
- 学习

建立习惯，好的习惯。它将为你决定好与坏，短期与长期，该做与不该做，以及对与错奠定基础。

但是，我们如何建立良好的习惯？好吧，光是这个话题我就可以写几篇文章了，但我现在要强调的是这几点:

- 找到一个习惯和一个你想培养它的理由。最终目标是什么？
- 为它找到一个触发点。触发器能激励你开始，并推动你坚持下去。例如，听音乐可以触发开始体育锻炼。
- 在知道自己的局限性和所有失败的机会的情况下，为它制定计划。
- 如果你没能维持这个习惯，想想什么地方出了问题。你需要它吗？重新调整，重新规划，再次开始。

## 2\. Find Your Passion

![5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/5.png)

Your `passion` keeps you going and helps you live a motivated professional and personal life. Passion is an "individual" thing that may impact many people in your circles. You can be passionate about technology, health, writing – anything that you love to do constantly.

However, one piece of advice I got early in my career was, "don't follow your passion blindly". The passion should be linked with your goals, career, and work. It is essential to find the difference between a hobby and a passion. You may have a hobby unrelated to your career, but your passion should relate to it.

It is essential to identify your passion, fuel it with a lot of practice, and renew it from time to time.

## 3\. Connect with People

![6](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/6.png)

`Social networking` for developers and the `developer communities` are influential in building your career. You get to meet like-minded people, find role models, get opportunities to collaborate, learn, and find jobs.

Whether you are a student, a fresher, or a veteran professional, social networking for developers is undoubtedly a great option to consider. The platforms like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/), [Showwcase](http://showwcase.com), and [Polywork](https://polywork.com/) are great ones to check out. You can connect with people of interest, learn from them, and contribute.

Learning and sharing is a wonderful cycle that builds knowledge. It grows when we come out of silos and learn in public. Also, learning from the experience of others will accelerate our growth. So, connect.

## 4\. Stay Curious

![7](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/7.png)

`Curiosity` is the desire to learn something new. Stay curious and be open to learning. Curiosity brings questions and doubts to mind. The fun is in finding the answers.

So, please ask questions when you have doubts, don't be shy thinking about whether it is a silly question, what people will think, and so on.

Staying curious will help you find how things work under the hood. There are many benefits of knowing the internals of things when it comes to programming. So, stay curious, and keep exploring.

## 5\. Develop Side Hustles

![8](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/8.png)

Here comes my favourite point, `Side Hustles`. When you build a habit of doing things, fuel your passion directed towards the career goal, look to learn new things, and connect with people, you have an ocean of opportunities for side hustles.

But wait, what are side hustles, and why are they needed? Don't we have enough things to do already? Yes, very practical questions. Let's get to them one by one.

Side hustles are anything you do outside of your regular job to earn knowledge, reputation, money, and growth. There are various form of side hustles like,

- Contributing to the open-source projects
- Writing articles on a blog
- Mentoring
- Teaching
- Freelancing
- Community Building
- Releasing books, e-books
- Speaking at conferences
- Creating video content...and many more

Now all these need time, and of course, you might have something called a "primary" job to take care of. However, most of the above don't need a massive amount of time or dedication. Also, all of these can be the by-product of your "primary" job.

Let's take a few examples:

- Have you solved a technical problem at work? Write about it as an article. Create a video explaining the steps and upload it on YouTube. Share about it on StackOverflow, the Showwcase community, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
- Do you have expertise in specific areas and have taken many notes on problem-solving? Move them to a doc and release them as an e-book. Don't worry about who will make use of them. There is always a great demand for quality content.
- Do you love to teach? Spend 1 hour over weekends interacting with people interested in your areas of expertise. Speak about the topic at a conference.

It is the right thing to do if you can manage side hustles without burnout. I have captured some of my personal experience doing [side projects as a developer here](https://blog.greenroots.info/why-do-you-need-to-do-side-projects-as-a-developer).

## 6\. Don't Neglect Soft Skills

![9](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/9.png)

`Soft skills` are all about how humans interact with other human beings at work, in personal life, anywhere in the world, and in any possible modes (physically, remotely, virtually). Unlike technical skills, soft skills are less about learning and more about realizing.

Here are a few soft skills that need special attention,

- Patience
- Empathy
- Problem solving
- Communication (not just the spoken or written language – it includes body language, confidence, resolving conflicts, and more)
- Teamwork
- Owning up to your mistakes or accountability
- Time management - we will talk about it in a while.

Some classes and courses teach you many of these soft skills. But you need to work on closing the gap yoursef and improve upon these skills gradually.

## 7\. Manage Your Time

![10](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/10.png)

Let me start with a confession. I'm still learning how to manage time, but the good news is that I'm getting better at it.

Each of us has 24 hours in a day. So we need to manage all our activities in that duration. However, the problem comes with too many things to fit in that duration.

Here are some practices (principles too) I've been following and seeing good results.

- Everything is not crucial to us every day. The tricky part is that we assume that something is essential until we give enough thought to it.
- So, we need to think and prioritize. It also includes regular activities like sleeping, exercise, eating food on time, health, family care, and so on.
- Do not focus on things that are of lower priority priority or can wait for the next day or week.
- Do not multi-task. It only increases stress and reduces productivity in the long run. Take up a task, focus on it in a time-boxed manner, complete it, and then get to the next one.
- Take breaks between task switches. Rejuvenate and energize yourself.
- If something is taking more time than anticipated, accept that it happens. You may not meet your time management plan every day.

I hope these pointers help you with enough thought processes to start managing time better.

## 8\. Find a Mentor

![11](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/04/11.png)

Do yourself a favour. Find a good mentor. Learning from someone's knowledge and experience is immensely beneficial. So let's understand who a mentor can be, what their role is, and how we can benefit as mentees.

A `mentor` is a person who provides guidance and advice to you to make your aspirations a reality. It could be for career-building, learning a new area, understanding the business processes, and many more.

A mentor may help share experiences and resources, provide motivation, and set and track individual and project goals. A mentor can also be a teacher, but in most cases, teaching focuses on "how," and mentoring focuses on "why".

A `mentee` is a person who is being mentored, guided, and advised by a mentor. A mentee approaches a mentor with aspirations, ambition, and desire. The mentor guides the mentee to help them achieve their goals.

The mentee drives it to success with the mentor's help in a mentoring program. The mentee decides how much help and guidance they need to achieve the mentorship goal.

A mentor and mentee relationship should be beyond just the technology and project knowledge sharing. It is also about understanding each other's emotional space to achieve the mentoring goals.

Now the most crucial part is `finding a good mentor`. Several platforms offer mentorship. There are some great mentors creating values for many aspiring people. You can always try your luck and find the best connection. I feel it is more authentic if you find someone from your network or community circle whom you know personally. That may even work out much better.

## In Summary

To summarize, focus on these points with all the pointers we have discussed in this article:

- Build good habits.
- Find your passion carefully.
- Connect with like-minded people and build your network.
- Stay curious, and keep learning.
- Use side hustles to grow.
- Soft skills are essential.
- Learn to manage your time.
