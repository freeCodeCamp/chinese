![如何有效地学习 JavaScript —— 技巧和学习策略](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2023/02/freeCodeCamp-Cover-2.png)

`JavaScript` 是一种广泛使用的编程语言，十多年来一直统治着软件开发技术栈。

你可以在 Web 应用程序、移动应用程序或你的桌面应用程序中找到 JavaScript。

根据 `Statista` 在 2022 年所做的一项调查，全球 JavaScript 开发者社区拥有约 1740 万成员，并且还在不断增长。

还有许多 JavaScript 框架和库，例如 React、Angular 和 Vue，它们正在解决各种用例和客户问题。在网上和教科书上也有许多学习 JavaScript 的资源。

尽管这门语言是如此有用和广为人知，但许多 JavaScript 开发人员仍然需要帮助才能自信地学习这门语言。他们也许能够在一些帮助下使用 JavaScript 完成日常开发任务，但可能需要澄清基本概念。此外他们可能很难调试问题和按时解决客户问题。

本文的目的根本不是要教你 JavaScript。如果你真的能从这么短的文章中学会 JavaScript，那就太好了，对吧。

相反，本文旨在教你`如何学习 JavaScript`，以帮助你成为一名自信的 JavaScript 开发人员。我将讨论在你学习 JavaScript 之前必须了解的策略和概念，使你的学习更有效率。

## 让我们回到`幼儿园`

在你早年学习口语或书面语言（如英语、西班牙语、印地语等）时，你是否在不知道单词的情况下开始造句？你的老师是否试图在不教你字母表的情况下让你拼写单词？可能不会！

任何编程语言也是如此。你必须知道如何循序渐进地学习它。事情是如何运作的？为什么存在某些概念？你不需要关注什么？简而言之，您需要了解`基本概念`。

正如你需要了解基本的语法和拼写概念才能用你自己的语言正确构成句子一样，编程语言也需要“某些东西”才能正确运行。编程语言的规则和语法称为`句法`。

顺便说一下，有趣的事实：如果你认为标题中的 Kindergarten 一词是拼写错误，那你就错了，就像我一样:

> 承认:  
>   
> 我不知道 “Kindergarden” 是不正确的拼写。其实是 “Kindergarten”。😲  
>   
> 如果你也发现它令人惊讶，请谷歌它。

我指出这一点是为了强调`语法`与`概念`一样重要！

考虑到这一切，让我们专注于学习 JavaScript。

## 如何使用 JavaScript 主题`气泡`

毫无疑问，JavaScript 是浩瀚无边的！作为一种编程语言，它涵盖了软件开发的所有重要方面:

-   作用域
-   函数式编程
-   数据类型
-   数据结构
-   操作
-   表达式
-   内存管理
-   反射
-   面向对象编程
-   网络接口
-   异步编程
-   异常处理
-   事件
-   不可变性
-   DOM
-   还有很多

如果我们继续，这个名单将会增加，但我们的目标是不同的。你只需要意识到，要掌握这门语言，你可能需要学习的主题数量是非常多的。但我无意吓唬你！

JavaScript 主题气泡

如果你是一名初级 JavaScript 开发人员，你可能想知道：

-   我可以这样做吗？
-   我需要学习多少课程和教程？
-   是不是太多了？
-   我如何记住我所学的一切？
-   总的来说，我怎样才能真正地学习 JavaScript？

让我们在进一步阅读时，一起寻找答案。

## Introducing a JavaScript Learning Model

Let me introduce a conceptual model for learning JavaScript. The model consists of strategies and concepts you must embrace to learn JavaScript effectively.

![image-67](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-67.png)

JavaScript Learning Model

The model is summarized in these six points, which I will expand on soon.

✅ First, you need to learn `Programming Concepts`.

✅ Concepts `>>>` Syntax.

✅ Create a `mind map` of related topics.

✅ Practice `incrementally`.

✅ You don't have to worry about most JavaScript `weird things`.

✅ Build `projects` that connect the concepts.

## Programming Concepts vs JavaScript in Particular

To begin with, separate the basic programming concepts from JavaScript specifically. These basic programming concepts are common among most programming languages.

Learning them well will help you to pick up any programming languages easily. Some fundamental programming concepts are:

-   **Variables**: In programming, variables are the human-readable names you provide to a memory location that stores a value. For example, `car`, `students`, and `oranges` are variable names.
-   **Values**: A value is something that we usually manipulate, change, or use to create other values. We assign values to variables. For example, `Honda` can be the value of the `car` variable.
-   **Data Types**: Data types indicate the particular type of a value like number, string, boolean, and others.
-   **Operators**: Operators in programming are symbols that help us perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, concatenation, and so on.
-   **Conditions and Control Flow**: Conditions in programming are statements that result in some actions. It's like if this happens, then do that, otherwise do some other thing.
-   **Loops**: Loops in programming are about repeating a bunch of tasks in the same sequence under a specific condition. There are different loops available in programming languages, and some common ones are a for-loop, while-loop, and do-while-loop.
-   **Functions**: Functions are a block of code you want to execute over and over again rather than repeating it everywhere. You create a function by giving it a name and a bunch of instructions to execute when you invoke it.
-   **Environment**: The programming environment allows developers to code, test, build, and deploy. The base principle remains the same for each aspect of the environment, but the technology may differ for different programming languages.
-   **Debugging**: Debugging is the art of finding and fixing problems in your code. You must know how to debug code irrespective of the language in which the code has been written.

All the points mentioned above are basic programming concepts. As a JavaScript developer, you must be familiar with these concepts.

## Concepts >>> Syntax

We discussed the differences between programming concepts and programming syntax. They both are important. But, understanding concepts helps us better than memorizing syntax.

>   
> ✅ Understanding Concepts.

Let's take an example problem statement that we might solve using coding.

**The problem statement:** If the colour variable has the value "red", return a red ball. Otherwise, return a green ball.

The JavaScript code to address this problem statement is pretty straightforward:

```js
if (color === "red") {
    // return a red ball 
} else if(color === "green") {
    // return a green ball
}
```

But if you memorize the above syntax and do not try to understand the concepts behind it, you may have problems in the future. If someone tweaks the problem statement a bit, your memorized code syntax may not work to produce the expected results.

In this problem statement, the programming concept used is `flow control`. So if you draw the flow control as a diagram and associate it with your code syntax, you will imprint the logic on your brain more permanently. Here's what it would look like:

![image-64](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-64.png)

Diagram showing control flow concept. Remember: Concept first, Syntax second.

If the problem statement changes, you change the flow, re-draw it, and map it back to your code.

## The JavaScript Topics Mind Map

When you pick up a JavaScript topic to learn, you start by going over any resources that you find helpful. It's an excellent first step, but more is needed for `effective learning`.

The effective way is to create a mind map of JavaScript topics and guide your learning. It will help you to know the concept well and familiarise yourself with related concepts. Another advantage of mind maps is with multiple topics, you form an intersection of common sub-topics to go over multiple times.

Here is an example of a mind map to learn the JavaScript `this` keyword. As you can see, the flow of topics moves logically through progressive concepts to help you get a foundational understanding of the `this` keyword in JavaScript.

![image-65](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-65.png)

Mind Map - The 'this' keyword

Another example could be understanding JavaScript promises. It would help if you started with functions, then the call stack and execution context, then learned about task and job queues and finally promises.

![image-66](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-66.png)

Mind Map - The promises

It may sound like a time-consuming process, but following the mind map approach to learning fundamentals will save you lots of time in the long run.

## Practice Incrementally

Practice makes you a better programmer. As you start understanding JavaScript concepts, you need to practice them. Practice incrementally to make your learning engaging and continuous. What does incremental practice mean, though?

In an incremental practice strategy, you start with a practice code example of a concept. When you go to the next concept in the mind map, you build your next practice code example on top of the previous example.

Let's say you are learning about JavaScript functions and practising by creating code snippets. Next, when you learn about scope or the scope chain, extend the same example you used for functions and inject the scope and scope chain concepts into it.

Say, you are learning to write a function that adds two numbers. You may come up with a `sum()` function like this:

```js
var sum = function(a,b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

By creating this function, you would have learned:

-   How to create a function
-   How to pass parameters to a function
-   How to return from a function
-   How to use function as an expressions

Next, a logical step will be to call/invoke the function.

```js
sum(2,3); // produces 5 as result
```

Great! Now when you learn about scope, you can use the same function to practice functional scope.

Take a look into the example below. Here the `calc()` function uses the same `sum()` we learned a while back.

```js
function calc() {
  var extra = 5;
  var sum = function(a,b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  let total = extra + sum(2,3);
}
console.log(extra); // is extra accessible here?
calc();
console.log(total); // is total accessible here?
```

In the `calc()` function we are trying to experiment with the scope of a couple of variables. In the same way, now you can write an example of a scope chain by using the same `calc()` function (and I am leaving that to your creativity to try out).

This strategy has a couple of advantages:

-   As your concepts are connected in a mind map, your examples are also connected topic by topic.
-   In the future, when you refresh your memory by looking back at any of the examples, it will be easier for you to traverse back and forth to connect the dots.

## Connect Concepts to Projects

While you practice the concepts incrementally, it is essential to create projects. When you follow a course or tutorial, you get to practice the exact project your instructor will teach. This is good, but can be better.

After you follow the instructor and complete the project, try to pause. Think, what else can you build with the concept you learned just now? You are on the right track if you can think of an idea or use case to build using the concept. Next, try implementing it.

You may get stuck in the implementation phase. Go back to your topic mind maps. Find which concepts you need to brush up on to remove the blockers. Read up on those concepts, practice them incrementally, and start back on the project. That's how you learn effectively!

Here are some ideas of projects to build to get you started as you're learning:

-   [20 Python projects for beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-for-beginners/)

## Is JavaScript Weird?

The rumors are that `JavaScript is weird`! Well, it can be, especially when you see code like these examples:

```js
+[] == +![]; // returns true

Number([]); // returns 0

null >= 0; // returns true

0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 // Who could believe, it returns fasle!

[10, 1, 3].sort() // Returns, [1, 10, 3]
```

How can you explain these? The only way you can explain these quirks is by explaining their underlying concepts. Besides a few tiny weird things (for example, the type of `null` is still an `object` in JavaScript), you can explain most syntax by understanding the underlying concepts. You'll need to try doing that to figure out these weird things.

## So, What's Next?

I hope this article provides insights and a less daunting path forward for `learning JavaScript effectively`. I've been working on JavaScript and frameworks/libraries based on it for over a decade. Everything I shared here is from my experience in learning the language deeply.

Try following the `six points` you have learned about the `JavaScript learning model`. Feel free to tweak them based on your needs. If you have any further queries, feel free to connect.
