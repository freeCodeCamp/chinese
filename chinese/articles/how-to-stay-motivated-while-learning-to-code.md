![How to Stay Motivated While Learning to Code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2022/06/cover-i-age-1.jpg)

学习编程可能就像准备一场持久的战役，最终地胜利并不总是取决于你最初的能力，而是你准备的有多好以及你能坚持多长时间。

当学习编程的时候，最大的挑战往往不是语言的复杂度，而是保持步调并且以学习的过程作为动机。

为了在你的学习过程中保持步调，你将需要许多动力与精力，通过持续不断地学习将帮助你理解编程语言中复杂的概念，学编程可不能一口吃成个胖子。

因为我没有接触过任何技术性的东西，所以我开始学习编程较晚。在我尝试迈出转码第一步后，每一步地学习都十分地挣扎，我越来越怀疑自己的动机。

这篇文章我将分享我如何随着时间的累积逐渐克服困难，从而坚持下来并且自我激励。

## 放平心态，养成习惯

在早期学习阶段，你可能没有太多的时间用来学习，这是因为你刚开始尝试做一些你从没有做过的事情，并且你可能有全职工作会占据你每日生活中大部分的时间，因此仅仅是挤出时间来学习就实属不易了。

在这个阶段，你并不需要担心你一口气能学多少，最重要的事情是抽出时间每天学，无论学了多少、无论发生什么情况，都要坚持下去！

## 始终为你的学习做好规划

如果你不管理好你的每日任务，你就十分容易拖延并且遗忘它们。你很容易专注于一两件任务上并且全然忘记你还有其他的任务要做，这种情况在你没有设置任务清单时会经常发生。

为了防止拖延及健忘，确保你通过制定任务来管理你的时间，你可以通过以下建议来制定你的任务：

1. 想想你总共有多少任务需要完成
2. 预估完成每项任务需要多少时间
3. 确定你一天什么时候最有生产力
4. 按优先级来安排好你所有的任务
5. 确保将相似的任务安排在一起从而提高效率
6. 在你的手机或电脑上排好任务以便管理
7. 将复杂及困难的任务安排在你脑子最好使的时候
8. 为意想不到的状况预留时间以防遭遇到它

值得一提的是最好是在每周开始的时候安排好一周的计划。

## 参加一个学习者社区

对于绝大多数人而言，独自学习可能是孤独且乏味的，而且很快就会伤害你的学习积极性，拥有志同道合的朋友一块儿准没错。

这种类型的社区将带给你无数的好处，包括但不限于：

-   获得组团学习的机会
-   得到不同的资源来帮助你学习成长
-   获取当下的技术趋势讯息
-   给你的个人项目带来反馈
-   扩展一个能分享你的进展、衡量你的成长的渠道

寻找你所在的地区是否存在这类型的社区。如果你找不到，你也可以加入一个远程学习社区来代替。

下面是一些我发现的远程社区，我觉得他们非常有价值：

-   **100Devs:** 这个社区是一个非营利性组织并且维护于 Leon Noel——一名老师、以及 ResilientCoders 的技术主管。100Devs 社区向个人提供免费的全栈网络开发课程，你可以[加入](https://t.co/N1svwNfVRd)他们。
-   **100DaysofCode:** 100DaysofCode 是一个 100 天学习编程语言的挑战。为了参加 100DaysofCode，你必须每天投入至少一小时的时间来学习，并且还需要在 Twitter 上发布你所完成的任务并且带上标签 #100DaysofCode。
-   **Kevin Powell Community:** Kevin Powell 主动学习者社区是一个 Discord 频道由 Kevin Powell 创建并维护。Kevin 是一个拥有多年经验的教师以及软件开发人员，你可以从这儿[加入](https://discord.gg/9NmT5HxN)。
-   **Commit Your Code:** Commit Your Code 社区由 Danny Thompson 创建，这个社区有很多主动学习者以及经验丰富的开发者，他们十分愿意帮助及指导你的项目。你可以从这儿[加入](https://discord.gg/3JvHFCCp)该社区。

当然了 freeCodeCamp 社区也拥有一个充满支持与善意的[论坛](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/)，你可以在这儿问问题并且邂逅其他的开发者。

在加入其中的一个或多个社区后，重要的是拿出你最好的态度，也别忘记保持自我，提供价值、遵守规则。

## 寻找一个学习伙伴

如果你即便是管理好你的任务并且加入一个学习社区后，还是很难坚持下来并保持动力，在这种情况下，你可能需要一名学习伙伴。

拥有学习伙伴可以从以下几个方面受益：

-   能让你建立起责任感
-   可以设置共同学习的时段
-   可以在合作项目上协作
-   可能会互相得到指导
-   一起通过编程挑战

## 使用更高效的学习技巧

编程语言通常来说都比较复杂。除非你有一个高效的学习技能，否则你会很难理解其中的概念并且很难运用在实际的情况中，这会使你沮丧并且打击你学习的动力。

如果你在学习一些新的概念或者新的编程语言，这里有一些学习技巧可能你已经尝试过：

-   repetitive reading, otherwise known as re-reading
-   highlighting
-   summarizing or making notes
-   cramming
-   反复阅读
-   突出重点
-   总结或做笔记
-   填鸭式学习

But there's lots of evidence from prominent scientists and psychologists that has proven that these techniques are less effective when compared to other study techniques you can use.
但是很多著名的科学家及心理学家通过大量的证据证明——对比以下的学习技巧，以上的学习技巧效果较差。

To make the best use of your time and ensure you remember what you have studied for a longer time, try the following study techniques:
为了最好的利用你的时间并确保你能更长时间地记住你所学的内容，请尝试以下的学习技巧：

### Active Recall
### 主动回忆

Active recall is a study technique that involves retrieving already stored information from your brain.

> The mind is a vast storehouse or space; memories are objects stored in that space; and retrieving a memory is akin to searching for and finding an object in a physical space (Roediger, 1980).

Using this technique involves reading a topic once and then converting concepts and ideas in the topic you have read into questions and then testing yourself on them.

### Spaced Repetition

This study technique, as its name suggests, involves spacing revisions of what you have learned by way of active recalling. This is in contrast to cramming, which involves memorizing all the concepts in a particular topic in a single sitting.

Essentially, spaced repetition helps you minimize the effect of The Forgetting Curve. It is a mode of learning by which you allow yourself to forget what you have learned. Then you try to retrieve those concepts from your brain by making active recalls at specific intervals over a period of time.

> The forgetting curve hypothesizes the decline of memory retention in time. This curve shows how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve))

![The-Forgetting-Curve-and-Spaced-Repetition](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/The-Forgetting-Curve-and-Spaced-Repetition.jpg)

Using the above study techniques will help you make sure that you are not spending too much time understanding and remembering any topic or concepts.

In addition, you will have more time to complete other tasks on your list, as well as the opportunity to learn new skills that will be helpful in your professional development.

One popular tool you can use to help with active recall and spaced repetition is Anki. Learn how to use Anki [here](https://leananki.com/how-to-use-anki-tutorial/#:~:text=You%20just%20open%20the%20app,spacebar%20to%20show%20the%20answer.&text=Using%20Anki%20default%20settings%2C%20Anki,you%20to%20recall%20the%20card.).

To learn more about the use of these efficient study techniques, watch the video below:

### Pomodoro timer

The Pomodoro study technique is ideal for people who struggle to concentrate on studying for a lengthy period of time.

One way to use this technique is to break your workday into 30 or 20 minute chunks separated by five minute breaks. These intervals are called Pomodoros.

## Set Short Term Goals and Stay Focused on Achieving One Goal at a Time

> Success doesn't happen overnight.

Trying to achieve too many objectives at the same time can be overwhelming. So it's always better to break your objective into shorter chunks of goals and focus on accomplishing one of the chunks or goals at a time.

For instance, let's say your goal is to be able to build a webpage with any of the popular JavaScript framework as a beginner. To do that, you'll need to learn various scripting and programming languages, tools, and skills. Here's what you should know to build a webpage:

1.  Understand the [basics of HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-html-beginners-course/).
2.  Understand the [basics of CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-in-this-free-6-hour-video-course/).
3.  Understand the use of [semantic elements in HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/semantic-html-alternatives-to-using-divs/).
4.  Understand the use of [CSS Flexbox and Grid for layouts](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-flexbox-and-grid-tutorial/).
5.  Try building a simple static website with what you have learned so far.
6.  Start learning the [basics of JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/).
7.  [Focus on building projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/) with your knowledge of HTML, CSS and the basics of JavaScript you have learned so far.
8.  Start learning advanced JavaScript concepts such as [Objective Oriented Programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-javascript-implements-oop/), and [Asynchronous Programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/synchronous-vs-asynchronous-in-javascript/).
9.  Solidify you knowledge on the advanced concepts by building projects with them.
10.  Learn the JavaScript framework of your choice. [React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-react-basics/), [Vue](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vue-js-full-course/), and [Angular](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-angular-full-course/) are all popular choices.
11.  Finally you can build your favourite project using the framework you have learned.

You might think that going through the steps above in the order they are stated would take you a few months. But it may take you much longer than that – and that's ok.

Also, don't try to skip any of these steps. Simply taking a crash web dev course likely won't be enough, and can set you up for disappointment and cause you to struggle much more than you would if you'd taken your time learning the concepts thoroughly.

On the other hand, making sure that you carefully go through each of the steps, one at a time, will help you to build the skills necessary to achieve your main goal. It will also prevent you from losing motivation, which is the likely result of having unrealistic expectations.

## Don't be Afraid to Ask for Help

One of the reasons why people give up early when learning programming is because they encounter some sort of bug in their program that seems difficult to solve.

But you should know that no one knows it all when it comes to programming. Even software developers with decades of experience still encounter bugs they find very hard to solve on their own.

This is a major reason why collaboration is so important – even more so than developing your personal skills.

Whenever you find yourself in this situation, do not linger on the problem for too long. Use the internet to your advantage when searching for answers. In this regard, your best friend is Google. You can get the answer to almost everything related to programming on Google if you take your time and search deeply.

If you are unable to get the answer you need from searching on Google, then the next step to take is to go to the study community you belong to get help from others. They will typically be more than willing to help you, whatever the problem may be.

Take note of the following when seeking help from your community:

-   Make sure to ask direct questions.
-   Make sure your questions are clear enough to understand.
-   Provide a copy of your code by putting them in a public remote repository such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or C[odepen](https://codepen.io/) and provide the link to the repository.

## Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle

I can't overemphasize the benefits of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It will help your maintain energy and keep you fit for the next challenge.

There are several ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle, some of which are:

-   Get regular exercise to help your cognitive abilities and general fitness.
-   Don't sit for lengthy periods of time.
-   Exercise your fingers regularly while you're studying.
-   Keep your eyes off your screen at regular intervals while you study.
-   Make time for your hobbies as a reward for your efforts.
-   Ensure you always sleep well and get a proper amount of rest.

## Conclusion

Programming is a marathon, not a sprint. If you want to achieve any level of success, you have to take your time and study consistently.

Taking the steps discussed in this article will significantly improve your chances of reaching your goals.
