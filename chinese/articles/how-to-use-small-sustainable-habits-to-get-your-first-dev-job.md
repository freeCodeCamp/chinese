过渡到新职业是极具挑战性和要承受很大的压力的事。

信息的数量不是问题。我们可以获取比以往更多的信息。但问题是如何有效利用我们获取的信息。

我在生活和事业获得的收获越大，我越相信，通往成功的道路不是设定巨大的目标，然后每天都为实现这些目标而努力。

路径在于你选择的目标，然后设计简单的系统，用于小习惯促进实现这些目标。

但是一个关键的部分，不要在达到目标时衡量你的成功，而是在每次成功执行在你的系统内。

这意味着你处在持续成功的状态，而不是在99%时间内处于失败状态，只有短暂的成功。

这不仅在心理上更好，而且提高了你实现目标的可能性。

在这篇文章中，我们将讨论如何将这一理念应用于获得你的第一份开发工作的目标。我也注意到，即使你已经从事开发工作，这些策略依然适用于任何一个希望建立一个更充实，更健全的职业生涯的人。

这一点很重要，所以我要重申一下。我们在这里不是寻找短期的胜利，我们是在设计一个系统，建立一个习惯的集合，你将在你的职业生涯中作为一名开发者。 

这些习惯不仅能让你找到第一份工作，而且随着你的进步，它们将帮助你扩大你的人脉，影响力和技能。这能帮助你找到你喜欢，报酬丰厚的工作，并有丰富的机会供你选择。

这里的大部分想法源泉是`BJ Fogg`的《小习惯》，`James Clear`的《原子习惯》，以及我在没有任何经验或教育下获得第一份开发工作的经历。

我现在在阅读《微小的习惯》，我非常喜欢书中对简单性的关注，所以我们在这篇文件中关注`Fogg`的技巧。

Let's get to it.

## Overview of the Tiny Habits Method

Very briefly, let's go over the philosophy and methodology of Tiny Habits. At its core, the system follows the idea that the best way to make consistent, lasting change is to make that change tiny – embarrassingly so.

Fogg argues that motivation is a poor tool to rely on when making lasting change. It fools us into thinking we can make significant change, because significant change is possible for a short time when we feel motivated.

The problem is that motivation doesn't last. So when the motivation wanes, you don't stick to the large, ambitious goal you set for yourself. Then you feel like a failure, so your motivation tanks more, and the cycle repeats itself for most of the big changes you want to make.

Instead, you should create the smallest possible action you can in working towards your goals.

So instead of trying to create a habit of doing 50 pushups per day, set a habit to do two.

Again, the idea rests on the habits being very very small. The point is that it should take almost no effort at all to do it. Then you instill the habit, and gradually increase the amount that you do.

As a general rule, the habit should take less than 30 seconds to complete.

Another crucial concept focuses on celebrating your wins immediately. You want to make the connection in your brains between successfully completing the habit and positive emotions.

It's cheesy, but I do a little mini dance every time I complete mine, a little something like this:

The other key component of creating Tiny Habits is the recipe. Tiny Habit recipes follow this formula:

After I \[anchor action\], I will \[tiny habit\].

This anchor action is crucial. This is a task that you already complete and that is already a solid part of your schedule that you anchor your new habit to.

It should be in the same location and have the same context as your new tiny habit.

So here's an example of a bad anchor and tiny habit:

After I take the dog out, I will floss one tooth.

Because the location and context are so different, this is unlikely to stick. Here's a better option:

After I brush my teeth, I will floss one tooth.

Again, I highly recommend you check out Fogg's book, Tiny Habits, for a much more thorough exploration of this method.

For now, let's look at how we can apply this method to launching a successful dev career.

## Tasks to Focus On

We want to focus on three main components for building out our dev career:

1.  Develop your skills
2.  Establish an online presence
3.  Start networking

Let's briefly go over these, and then we'll cover how to translate them into the Tiny Habit methodology.

### Develop Your Skills

This one is pretty self-explanatory. You need to grow your development skills if you want to be a developer. The key here is to make sure you [don't get stuck in tutorial hell forever](/news/how-to-learn-from-coding-tutorials-and-avoid-tutorial-hell/).

Tutorial hell is appealing because following tutorials and courses does not take nearly as much mental or creative energy as building something from scratch does.

So you fool yourself into thinking you are learning when all you are really doing is copying what someone else did.

But building that out, having it work smoothly, and then seeing the finished product makes your brain feel good, so the habit solidifies and the cycle continues.

Here you want to start building the tiny habit of writing your own code and building your own things so you can replace that feedback loop with a more useful one.

### Establish an Online Presence

Building an online presence encompasses a few different things. The most important are social media and your portfolio site. When I say social media I mean Twitter and LinkedIn.

Say what you want about them – and I definitely have my issues – but they are invaluable when trying to start and grow a career.

As with most things, the key to growing on these platforms is to be consistent. So this is a perfect fit for the Tiny Habits framework, too.

Engagement on these platforms is huge, especially at the beginning when your account is still small, so you really want to make sure you are showing up every day.

### Start Networking

Finally we have networking. Although there is some networking included in our online presence component because of interacting with other people, the [networking we want to focus on here is more direct](/news/networking-for-aspiring-developers/).

When you are first starting out, it can be very helpful to start reaching out to companies you admire directly, telling them so, and introducing yourself.

This is a bit of a secret weapon because very few people do it, but it's very powerful.

Let's look at how we can create some Tiny Habits around these three main goals. Remember, the goal is to start embedding the habit in your brain. Then you can increase the amount of each of these things over time.

## How to Develop Tiny Habits

You'll need to come up with the anchor actions on your own. Anchor actions are specific to each person, because they consist of things you already do as part of your routine.

So I'll give you recommended Tiny Habits, along with my anchors, but ultimately you'll need to come up with your own.

For skill development, I recommend something very simple:

**After I take my first sip of coffee, I will write one line of code in my own project.**

Remember, the anchor action should be specific to you. I already make coffee before I start working in the morning, so the first sip is my anchor.

Don't discount this because of the simplicity and ease of the task. That's the point. Make it ridiculously easy to start and the snowball will grow as you gradually increase the task.

Now, for online presence:

**After I check my email, I will write one thoughtful reply on Twitter.**

Again, I'm using what is an existing part of my routine and then anchoring my habit to that.

Finally, for networking:

**After I check Twitter, I will write down one person I want to reach out to.**

Same concept here.

These are just examples, and I recommend you start with just these three for a few days while you get used to how this works. Then you can gradually start to expand the habits and start to add more for the particular tasks you have.

Please don't overcomplicate this or try to add anything more. The goal is to make it so small and so easy that it feels stupid and pointless to not do it. These will begin to compound as you begin to build that habit and execute on it every day.

And don't forget the celebration! That part is crucial for forming the pathways in your brain that will make executing on these actions sustainable and fun.

## Wrapping up

So much of why people struggle to make progress on their goals is because they go too big too fast or struggle with information overload.

This simple system solves both of those problems, but we naturally resist it because it seems too small to make a difference.

In reality, when we go overboard for a day or two, then burn out for a week or two, we are taking one step forward and two steps back. No matter how big the steps are, we aren't making progress.

But when we implement the Tiny Habits method, we might be taking miniature little baby steps, but we're taking them every day and always forward.
