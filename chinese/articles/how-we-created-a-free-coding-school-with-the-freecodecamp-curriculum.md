_这是一张学生在课室上课的照片，由于新冠肺炎疫情我们采取了全面的远程教学。_

若你想学习编程，你总共有三种方法可以选择：

1.  你可以自学或寻找相关的课程
2.  到学院或者大学选修计算机学科/信息技术学位
3.  或者参与编程学校。编程学校是动手实作的速成班，课程的设计可以让你快速寻地在3个月至1年的时间内找到自己的第一份软件开发工作。

虽然第一个选项是最便宜的，但是它也是最让人感到挫折和困难的一个选项。我们会在自学编程的一路上遇到各种障碍导致我们想要放弃。

如果你可以有时间请假（或者每周减少工作数小时），当你在寻找新工作时支付生活开销的同时缴交编程课程的费用，同时还可以照顾家庭和个人生活的话，那第二个和第三个选项会是不错的选择。但我相信不是所有人都可以做到。

这就是为什么我们创办了 [freeCodeSchool Indy][1] 。这是一个采用 freeCodeCamp 课程的免费编程课程，我们会在3个月的业余时间指导学生完成编程学校的课程。

我们每周有两堂两小时的课程 - 星期一和星期三的傍晚6时至晚上8时，我们会教导从基本的 HTML 到 JavaScript 的所有东西甚至还会介绍 React。

每位学生需要花大约每周6个小时的时间自学，他们可以选择参与我们在星期日下午1时至5时举办的课程。若学生们在首三个月内完成第一个课程，那他们就可以参与接下来三个月的第二个课程，学习使用 Node.js 进行后端网页开发。

我们开始了这项计划一年多了，此时我们可以很高兴地说在今年五月份我们顺利完成了第一轮的教学。现在我们可以在这篇文章分享我们所学到的东西。

## 我们的目标是建立一所免费的编程学校

起初我们的目标是希望提供所有人有效和便捷的教育，不论任何收入和生活挑战（例如需要向公司请假）。

我们并不是想要挑战任何的训练营或者原有的编程学校，当然他们也是提供了学生非常有价值的服务。我们只是尝试提供需要弹性安排课程时间或负担不起编程学校学费的人另外一个更合适的管道。

学生将会接收来自员工，自愿者，社区会员或者是已完成我们课程的校友的教导和指引。

当然我们希望我们的学生可以在职场上找到自己想要的工作，但我们并没有能力保证任何事情。我们只能竭尽所能提供更多的支持让学生自己决定要继续自学，或者是参与正统的课程，如编程学校或者学院。

就像我之前所说的，这一切花了我们团队一年的时间，我们必须寻找合适的地点和教师当然还要觉得课程的走向和安排活动。接下来就是我们的筹备过程。

## 我们如何安排课程

我们做的第一件事情就是决定课程的时长与目标。我们最终决定实行3个月的课程让学生学会基本的 HTML, CSS 和 JavaScript。另外还有额外知识比如说 Bootstrap 和 React 组件。 

若一切按照计划进行，我们计划是让完成第一阶段的学生放一个月的长假然后进行第二阶段的课程。第二阶段的课程同样进行3个月，这次的课程会沿用学生们在第一阶段学习到的知识，教导学生关于 JavaScript 框架和介绍 Node.js 。

从一个小型和仅仅3个月的业余课程开始，有助于我们学会如何安排和调整长期计划。这个课程让学生有个短期的目标，使学生可以在数个月的时间内完成自己的个人小型专案。

[这是我们在 Github 上的社群][2]。 我们会不断地更新资源和提供开源资料。

## 融合 freeCodeCamp 的课程

开发课程将会花费非常多的时间和金钱。幸运的是 freeCodeCamp 已经有了完善的免费课程供我们没有附加条件的使用和修改。

因此我们采用了 freeCodeCamp 的课程并跟从它的原有的纲要安排我们的课程。我们采用了挑战的内容当作是学生需要在课堂内完成的作业。我们也采用了 freeCodeCamp 的个人报告当作学生的小组作业。

过程中我们也鼓励学生尝试更多课程以外的作业，以便学生能够在进行或者结束课程的时候有能力领取 freeCodeCamp 的文凭认证。

## How We Found a Space to Host Classes

The Indianapolis Public Library generously agreed to host our classes and give us space for office hours as well. The size of the space in the computer lab was limited, so the maximum number of students we could take per class was 22.

We could have used a larger conference room in the library to accommodate a larger class, but then we wouldn't have been able to take students who didn't own a laptop – and that wouldn't have been very accessible for everyone.

We didn't plan to be a remote program, so we had to adjust our classes to use Discord for lectures and all student communication when COVID-19 happened. More on that later.

## How we Chose Technology Tools

We prepared a Discourse forum (like the freeCodeCamp forum) before the classes started so students could log in, get announcements, ask questions, and post assignments. It also gave the admin staff some privileges to keep track of students and moderate student interactions.

## How we Administered the School

### Finding Students

When we were planning this program, our worry was that we would not get enough interest and all our planning would be for nothing. The reality was that we had way too much interest and could not accommodate every student. For 22 slots, we had over 140 people who wanted to participate! And that was without doing that much marketing.

It was very exciting to get so much interest in our program, but we also had to decide which students to take and how to choose in a fair way.

We decided to whittle down the field by requiring people to show up for three pre-screening activities where they would complete some basic challenges, like  [Code.org's Flappy Game][3]. This let us know which students were dedicated to showing up and got the number of people in line down to around 80. That was still too way too many for the space we had so had to do a random lottery to select the final students.

### Teaching Students

Every student learns differently and has their own personality and preferences. It's unreasonable to expect that we can just lecture the students for an hour and they will all be able to pick up all that information and build the lab without issue.

We decided on a format for lectures where we start off every lecture by asking if anyone has questions – usually we don't get many. Then, we go into the slides, and pause every ~15 minutes to give the students guided 'labs' so they can try out coding on their own with the support of having instructions and still being able to ask questions in the classroom.

We also often leave the last 30+ minutes of the 2-hours classes for the students to be able to work on their class projects.

### Collecting Assignments

Some people don't turn in assignments. This could mean they are shy about sharing their code where other students can see, or that they just don't think it's necessary since it's a free coding school after all, and some of their classmates aren't doing it either.

If it's the former, then we encourage them to share assignments with just the staff and let them know that we have all been in their shoes before.

If they aren't turning in assignments because they don't want to... well, there isn't much we can do about that. We try to discourage students from joining the class who don't want to fully participate in the program.

The assignments were originally being turning in on the forum, but we were getting really low engagement on there. Students weren't logging in very often and they were never asking questions there.

Now assignments are turned in via a Discord channel on the server we have for our coding school.

Since we manage our whole program from the same Discord server – including hosting lectures, answering questions, and managing the program – we are seeing an increase in the number of assignments turned in. We are also getting more useful feedback that students are getting from staff and volunteers.

### Deadlines

Should we have deadlines for turning in projects? Our opinion right now is no, we shouldn't.

Most of the first cohort got a bit behind and some of them finished the program weeks after the end. Should we punish people who finish, but just not on time? We don't think so and here is why: Everyone learns at their own pace.

If someone finishes in 3 months and another student in 4 months, then they both should be rewarded the same for completing the program.

Someday, we will be able to have rolling admissions for our coding and help students at a more granular level. Until then, the least we can do is stay flexible to accommodate them and let them turn in the rest of the projects whenever they can.

### Getting Students to Ask for Help

This has been one of our biggest problems! Some people fall behind and some students are confused but don't want to ask for help. Some students are so confused that they don't even know what kind of help to ask for.

You can't really force people to get help, but you can prompt them. The best way we have found to get them to ask questions is to do short review segments at the beginning of lectures and have scheduled study times where students can pop in and ask questions in a much smaller group setting.

If they prefer to type out the question, they can post it in the student chat or send a private message to one of the organizers.

We can only do so much. If students are lost or confused and don't want to ask for help, there is no way for us to fix that. We try hard to meet them where they are, but they also have to make some effort to come to us.

### Student Surveys

Performing regular student surveys is really helping us to get critical feedback for our program.

Our first time through, we collected information about student goals and background at the beginning, then took a student survey at the half-way point - around 6 weeks in – and then another survey at the end.

While we received a lot of good information, in hindsight, we should have taken more surveys and added a few more questions. This time, we will probably perform surveys to get student feedback every month. Here are some of the questions we are asking:

1.  What do you think about the program so far? Is it meeting your expectations?
2.  Do you feel like the lectures are helpful for doing the assignments?
3.  How can we better help you achieve your goals?
4.  Do you have any other feedback for us?

### Dealing with Drop Outs

Life happens, things change. We have to understand that students who fully intend to participate might have to drop out due to unavoidable circumstances.

If they communicate with us about the situation, we offer them a spot in the next cohort.

If they simply do not show up or communicate with us, then they are free to reapply in the future, but no spot will be saved for them.

## Staff and Volunteers

### Soliciting Volunteers

Without volunteers, it would be quite overwhelming to run a program like this. Here are some of the different types of volunteers you will need to be successful.

### Responsibilities:

1.  **Organizers –** Yes, we are volunteers too.  We are fortunate to have an amazing team of organizers who run the program. This includes myself, two other developers, and a computer lab supervisor from the library who also knows how to code. We chat several times per week in Discord to make sure the program is running smoothly and students are progressing. I think 3-5 is a pretty good number for an organizing team, but we might add more to do specific things, such as 'community manager' or 'volunteer coordinator.'
2.  **Presenters –** These people give lectures during class times or special help sessions held on weekends usually. This is the hardest type of volunteering to manage. In our program, the lectures are 1.5-2 hours long and there are only 24 of them, so every single one has to be on point and flow with the rest of the curriculum. Some well-meaning volunteers might not be the right fit for giving lectures for people who are brand new to development. It is  **very**  important to be clear about what you want them to cover in the lecture, down to the individual points and expected learning outcomes. We also made sure to give volunteers a boilerplate slide deck to work off of so it matched the rest of the curriculum.
3.  **Mentors –**  Students will not only have coding questions, but also have questions about their careers, networking, etc. Mentorship is great for answering these types of questions. We are currently working on setting up our mentorship program where volunteer mentors will check in with students at least once per week to make sure they are on track and answer any questions they have. One of the reasons for the delay is we have been working on a system for how to handle any complaints of inappropriate language or behavior that might take place when students meet one on one with volunteers.
4.  **Lab Assistants –**  Lab assistants are there to help out synchronously during live lab sessions, usually with problems running software or debugging. We utilized lab assistants much more when we held in-person classes. With things being remote, we can't see the students' screens so we have had to just have a few people available to answer questions in the chat if people get stuck.
5.  **General Helpers –** These people help answer students' questions in the chat and perform other tasks like reviewing projects and portfolios. They are also useful for students to rubber duck off of or for encouragement.

### Volunteer Handbook

We made a two-page handbook detailing expectations for volunteer behavior as well as requirements for participation in our program. It's pretty basic right now, but we will be building off of it as we go along I'm sure.

We also give them a link to the  [freeCodeCamp code of conduct][4]  because it's short, sweet, and to the point: be kind, understanding, etc.

### Making Sure Staff has the Tools to Succeed

We have definitely made a few mistakes, including letting a presenter make his own slides and then having to tell him at the last minute that they needed to change. It didn't go over well. We should have been much clearer with what we wanted from him.

Now, everyone receives a boilerplate slide deck from us as well as a list of topics to cover. We also connect with them several times to go over the progress in their presentation to make sure it's on the right track.

Right now, we have a volunteer handbook, lesson plans and slide decks for teaching, guidelines for mentoring, and google drive folder where we keep all of the documentation for the program, student progress, curriculum materials, and future plans. We recently re-organized all of these materials to make them easier to locate when we need them.

As this program grows, we are going to need to manage more volunteers and even paid staff. We are preparing for this by documenting our processes to make onboarding a little bit smoother each time.

### Community Partners

We are currently trying to form community partnerships to get sponsors for funding as well as donations of tech equipment.

Some of our students don't have access to good computers or a fast internet connection. The library provided those things for us when we hosted in person classes, but it's been more difficult now that we are remote.

Also, libraries only have limited hours, and, for students who work multiple jobs or have other family obligations, it can be difficult to make the time to do all of the class work during the day. This is why the sponsorship of community partners is so important to making our program accessible.

In the future, we hope to be able to provide internet access and laptop computers for students who need them.

## Organizing

### Marketing

We don't have any marketing experts on our team. Our marketing efforts basically consist of making sure we keep our branding that we agreed upon - colors, verbiage, etc. - consistent and collectively sharing updates on social media.

Fortunately, I have a small following on  [YouTube][5], LinkedIn, and other platforms where I have been able to solicit volunteers and get some community interest in our program.

The public library has also been helpful with reaching out to many different communities and pulling in students that we might never have been able to reach otherwise.

As we grow, we might start expanding our social media reach, but with a limited budget right now, we are just gaining traction organically.

### Remote Livestreams

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-08-at-10.10.27-PM.png)

Discord screen sharing interface.

Hosting remote livestreams has been challenging. Internet connections sometimes drop, plus there is a learning curve for students to be able to use the software.

Discord has been a great option for us, because we can host livestreams inside of the app where all of our chats and everything else are located. This way, we only have to explain how to use one piece of software.

In addition, Discord allows us to screen share with up to 50 people at a time in the voice chat rooms. And that's all for free! We looked into Zoom and some other tools, but we are going to stick with Discord until we need - and can afford - something with more features.

### Incorporating & Funding

We wanted to start asking companies and people for funding so we had to incorporate as a non-profit last year. In the US, this process takes about six months. We first had to register as a company with our state and then draw up business documents and apply for non-profit status with the federal government.

At the beginning of this year, we finally got confirmation that we are a 501c3 non-profit organization! Now we are trying to work out ways of getting funding and taking donations. We're going to add a 'donate' button to our website and we are also reaching out to companies to solicit larger donations. There have also been some internal discussions about whether or not crowdfunding is a good idea.

Do you have any suggestions for us in this area? Please leave a comment on this article or reach out to us at contact@freecodeschoolindy.com.

## Communication Tools

### Forum

As previously mentioned, we started off using a Discourse forum, but found that it was hard to maintain and wasn't meeting our needs. People found it hard to use, especially on mobile. We also had trouble getting staff and students to login and check it often enough to make it worth the effort. That is why we got rid of the forum and moved our whole program over to Discord.

### Discord

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-04-at-12.43.36-PM.png)

We now have a Discord server set up for the whole coding school! We use it to host live lectures - we can have up to 50 people in the voice chat and screen share with them at the same time, manage students, organize volunteer activities, coach speakers, answer questions, do group projects, review portfolios, and perform administrative tasks.

Having everything in one place has been the best decision we have ever made. Not only are our costs lower, but it makes the program administration so much easier. Everyone we need to interact with is either already on Discord, or just needs to be invited to Discord :)

## Graduation

We had grand plans of doing our first in-person graduation for students this year. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, those plans had to be scrapped. We had to make do with mailing out certificates to students who completed the program and giving everyone a (virtual) pat on the back for finishing.

Now that our classes are virtual, we would love to be able to do something fun for the graduation of our second cohort at the end of August. Do you have any ideas? Let us know if you do.

## Conclusion

Putting this program together might have been the hardest thing I've ever done. It's a lot of work but very rewarding. It can be life-changing for students.

It wasn't just me though: There was a team of people helping out and none of this would have happened without them.

I want to give special thanks to  [Jared Wilcurt][6], Casssandra Bautista, Marianne Mckenzie,  [The Indianapolis Public Library][7], freeCodeCamp, and all of our wonderful volunteers – all of whom were crucial in putting this program together.

We are working on open-sourcing our curriculum we used – slides, projects, freeCodeCamp challenges, supplementary material, and so on. It's taking a little bit of time to put everything together in a nice format, but be patient, we will get it out to anyone who is interested soon :)

I'm interested in your thoughts. Do you have any ideas for things we can do better next time around? Please reach out to me and let me know.
