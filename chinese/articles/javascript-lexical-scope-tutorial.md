![Lexical Scope in JavaScript – What Exactly Is Scope in JS?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2021/08/kristina-tripkovic-EGmwwDzme6s-unsplash-javascript-lexical-scope-codesweetly.jpg)

The term “**lexical scope**” may seem tricky to grasp at first glance. But it's helpful to understand what each word means.

So this article will explain lexical scope by first examining the meaning of “lexical” and “scope”.

So, let’s get it started by understanding the term “scope”.

## What exactly is Scope?

**Scope** refers to the _area_ where an item (such as a function or variable) is visible and accessible to other [code](https://www.codesweetly.com/document-vs-data-vs-code/).

**Note:**

-   **Scope** means area, space, or region.
-   **Global scope** means global space or a public space.
-   **Local scope** means a local region or a restricted region.

**Here's an example:**

```js
// Define a variable in the global scope:
const fullName = "Oluwatobi Sofela";

// Define nested functions:
function profile() {
  function sayName() {
    function writeName() {
      return fullName;
    }
    return writeName();
  }
  return sayName();
}
```

[**Try it on StackBlitz**](https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-fqqxjl?file=script.js)

In the snippet above, we defined the `fullName` variable in the global scope. This means that it is visible and accessible globally to all code within the script.

But we defined `writeName()` within the `sayName()` function, so it is locally scoped to `sayName()`.

In other words, `writeName()` is locally visible and accessible only to code in the `sayName()` function.

Keep in mind that whenever the `writeName()` function gets invoked, the computer will _not_ go straight to the global scope to call the `fullName` variable. Instead, it must sequentially go through the [scope chain](#what-is-a-scope-chain) to look for `fullName`.

## What is a Scope Chain?

A **scope chain** refers to the _unique_ spaces that exist from the scope where a variable got _called_ to the global scope.

**Here's an example:**

```js
// Define a variable in the global scope:
const fullName = "Oluwatobi Sofela";

// Define nested functions:
function profile() {
  function sayName() {
    function writeName() {
      return fullName;
    }
    return writeName();
  }
  return sayName();
}
```

In the snippet above, observe that the `fullName` variable got called from the `writeName()` function's scope.

Therefore, the scope chain that exists from the variable’s call to the global scope is:

**writeName() scope ---> sayName() scope ---> profile() scope ---> global scope**

In other words, there are four (4) spaces from `fullName`’s invocation scope to its lexical scope (the _global scope_ in this instance).

**Note:** The global scope is the last link in [JavaScript](https://www.codesweetly.com/html-css-javascript/)'s scope chain.

## How Does the Scope Chain Work?

JavaScript's scope chain determines the hierarchy of places the computer must go through — one after the other — to find the lexical scope (origin) of the specific variable that got called.

For instance, consider the code below:

```js
// Define a variable in the global scope:
const fullName = "Oluwatobi Sofela";

// Define nested functions:
function profile() {
  function sayName() {
    function writeName() {
      return fullName;
    }
    return writeName();
  }
  return sayName();
}
```

In the snippet above, whenever the `profile()` function gets invoked, the computer will first invoke the `sayName()` function (which is the only code in the `profile()` function).

Secondly, the computer will invoke the `writeName()` function (which is the only code in the `sayName()` function).

At this point, since the code in `writeName()` instructs the computer to call and return the `fullName` variable's content, the computer will call `fullName`. But it will not go directly to the global scope to call `fullName`.

Instead, the computer must go _step-by-step_ through the _scope chain_ to look for the _lexical scope_ of `fullName`.

So, here are the sequential steps the computer must take to locate `fullName`'s lexical scope:

1.  Firstly, the computer will check if `fullName` got defined locally within the `writeName()` function. But it will find no `fullName` definition there, so it moves up to the next scope to continue its quest.
2.  Secondly, the computer will search for `fullName`'s definition in `sayName()` (the next space in the scope chain). Still, it doesn't find it there, so it climbs up the ladder to the next scope.
3.  Thirdly, the computer will search for `fullName`'s definition in the `profile()` function. Yet still, `fullName` is not found there. So the computer goes forward to seek `fullName`'s lexical scope in the next region of the scope chain.
4.  Fourthly, the computer goes to the _global scope_ (the following scope after `profile()`). Fortunately, it finds fullName's definition there! Therefore, it gets its content (`"Oluwatobi Sofela"`) and returns it.

## Time to Practice with Scope 🤸‍♂️🏋️‍♀️🏊‍♀️

Consider the script below. Which of the three `fullName` variables will the computer call?

```js
// First fullName variable defined in the global scope:
const fullName = "Oluwatobi Sofela";

// Nested functions containing two more fullName variables:
function profile() {
  const fullName = "Tobi Sho";
  function sayName() {
    const fullName = "Oluwa Sofe";
    function writeName() {
      return fullName;
    }
    return writeName();
  }
  return sayName();
}
```

Will the computer call the first, second, or third `fullName` variable?

**Note:** You will benefit much more from this tutorial if you attempt the exercise yourself.

If you get stuck, don’t be discouraged. Instead, review the lesson and give it another try.

Once you’ve given it your best shot (you’ll only cheat yourself if you don’t!), go ahead to see the correct answer below.

## Did you get it right?

Out of the three `fullName` _definitions_ present in the script above, the computer will call and return the one defined in the `sayName()` function.

`sayName()`’s `fullName` variable will get called because `sayName()` is the scope inside which the computer will first find a `fullName` definition.

Therefore, when `profile()` gets invoked, the returned value will be `"Oluwa Sofe"`.

**Some things to keep in mind:**

-   Suppose the computer did not find `fullName`'s definition in any of the scopes. In such a case, the computer will return `Uncaught ReferenceError: fullName is not defined`.
-   The global scope is always the last scope of any JavaScript scope chain. In other words, the global scope is where all searches will end.
-   An inner (child) scope has access to its parent (outer) scope, but an outer scope does not have access to its child scope.  
    For instance, in the snippet above, `writeName()` can access codes inside any of its parent scope (`sayName()`, `profile()`, or the _global scope_).  
    However, neither `sayName()`, `profile()`, nor the _global scope_ can access any of `writeName()`'s codes.

## Quick Review of Scope So Far

JavaScript scope is all about space.

So next time your partner calls you to their private scope, remember they are inviting you to their private space 😜!

When you get there, be sure to ask them about their best lexical game...

But what does lexical mean, I hear you ask? Let’s find out below.

## What Does Lexical Mean?

**Lexical** refers to the definition of things.

Anything related to creating words, expressions, or variables is termed _lexical_.

For instance, a [scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble) game is a lexical activity because it relates to the creation of words.

Also, someone whose job relates to linguistics (the study of languages) has a lexical career.

**Note:** Another name for a dictionary is a _lexicon_. In other words, a lexicon is a dictionary where words are listed and defined.

So now that we know what scope and lexical mean, we can talk about lexical scope.

## What is Lexical Scope in JavaScript?

**Lexical scope** is the _definition_ area of an expression.

In other words, an item's lexical scope is the place in which the item got _created_.

**Note:**

-   Another name for lexical scope is _static scope_.
-   The place an item got invoked (or called) is not necessarily the item's lexical scope. Instead, an item's _definition space_ is its lexical scope.

### Example of Lexical Scope

Consider the code below:

```js
// Define a variable in the global scope:
const myName = "Oluwatobi";

// Call myName variable from a function:
function getName() {
  return myName;
}
```

In the snippet above, notice that we _defined_ the `myName` variable in the global scope and _called_ it in the `getName()` function.

**Question:** Which of the two spaces is `myName`’s lexical scope? Is it the _global scope_ or the `getName()` function’s local scope?

**Answer:** Remember that _lexical scope_ means _definition space_ — not _invocation space_. Therefore, `myName`’s lexical scope is the _global scope_ because we defined `myName` in the global environment.

### Another example of lexical scope

```js
function getName() {
  const myName = "Oluwatobi";
  return myName;
}
```

**Question:** Where is `myName`’s lexical scope?

**Answer:** Notice that we created and called `myName` within `getName()`. Therefore, `myName`’s lexical scope is `getName()`’s local environment because `getName()` is `myName`’s definition space.

## How Does Lexical Scope Work?

A JavaScript expression’s definition environment determines the [code](https://www.codesweetly.com/document-vs-data-vs-code/) permitted to access it.

In other words, only code within an item's lexical scope can access it.

For instance, consider the code below:

```js
// Define a function:
function showLastName() {
  const lastName = "Sofela";
  return lastName;
}

// Define another function:
function displayFullName() {
  const fullName = "Oluwatobi " + lastName;
  return fullName;
}

// Invoke displayFullName():
console.log(displayFullName());

// The invocation above will return:
Uncaught ReferenceError: lastName is not defined
```

Notice that the invocation of `displayFullName()` in the snippet above returned an `Uncaught ReferenceError`. The error returned because only code within an item's lexical scope can access the item.

Therefore, neither the `displayFullName()` function nor its internal code can access the `lastName` variable because `lastName` got defined in a different scope.

In other words, `lastName`’s lexical scope is different from that of `displayFullName()`.

`lastName`’s definition space is `showLastName()` while `displayFullName()`’s lexical scope is the global environment.

Now, consider this other code below:

```js
function showLastName() {
  const lastName = "Sofela";
  return lastName;
}

// Define another function:
function displayFullName() {
  const fullName = "Oluwatobi " + showLastName();
  return fullName;
}

// Invoke displayFullName():
console.log(displayFullName());

// The invocation above will return:
"Oluwatobi Sofela"
```

In the snippet above, `displayFullName()` successfully returned `"Oluwatobi Sofela"` because `displayFullName()` and `showLastName()` are in the same lexical scope.

In other words, `displayFullName()` could invoke `showLastName()` because the two functions are both defined in the global scope.

**Note:**

-   In example 2 above, `displayFullName()` did not gain access to `showLastName()`'s `lastName` variable.  
    Instead, `displayFullName()` invoked `showLastName()` — which then returned the content of its `lastName` variable.
-   An alternative to the lexical scope is the [dynamic scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scope_vs._dynamic_scope_2) — but it rarely gets used in programming. Only a few languages, like bash, use dynamic scope.

## Wrapping it up

Any time you hear lexical, think definition.

So, the lexical scope of a car, variable, phone, function, or swimsuit refers to its definition region.
