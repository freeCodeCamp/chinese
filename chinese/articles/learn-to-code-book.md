[如何在 2023 年学习编程并入行程序员 [完结]](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2023/01/Learn-to-Code-and-Get-a-Developer-Job-Book.jpg)

如果你打算学习编程并成为一名开发者，希望这本书对你有帮助。

这本书已编写完毕，完全免费。你可以在此阅读。

几年前，纽约市的 5 家头部出版商找到我，希望与我合作出书。我和他们当面聊了下，可当时我根本抽不出时间来写书。

现在我终于有时间写书了，而且我打算让大家在 freeCodeCamp 上免费阅读我写的这本书。

信息本身即是自由且免费的，对吧？🙂（注：原文 "Information wants to be free" 旨在表达信息本应无障碍地被人们获取，见[此词条](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free)，英文中的 free 既有“自由”也有“免费”之意；另外，此处译文参考自[这里](https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/chinese/information/)）

这本书包括了我对学编程和成为开发者的许多思考，因此篇幅较长，通读可能需要几个小时。

以下是我的个人经历：

- 30 多岁开始学习编程
- 然后成为软件工程师
- 之后，我于 8 年前（2015 年）创办了 freeCodeCamp.org。现在，每天都有一百多万人来这里学习数学、编程和计算机科学

在这之前，我是一名从未接触过编程的英语老师。不过，我在开始学习编程一年后就拿到了我的第一份开发者工作。

在这个过程中，我没有花一分钱购买书籍或参与任何课程。

（确切地说我其实花钱了，因为我经常跑到周边城市参加了技术会议。后文中会提到，这些钱花得非常值得）

做了几年软件工程师之后，我觉得是时候改变一下了：我想教会其他人如何实现职业生涯的转换。

一开始我尝试着做了一些技术类的教学工具，但反响平平。直到有一个周末，我上线的 freeCodeCamp.org 竟成为了爆款，吸引了很多用户，逐步构建了 freeCodeCamp 社区。

一直以来，我们在社区内互相帮助。现在，全世界的人们得以通过 freeCodeCamp 来为自己的第一份技术工作做准备。

你也许会想：“我可能没那么多时间读完整本书”。

没关系，你可以随时标注读到了哪里；之后有空了随时回来继续读。这本书会一直在这里等你。

或许你还可以尝试在社交网络上分享，说：“看，我在读这本书”，并附上链接。你可能想不到，这是一种很好的激励方式，有助于你尽快读完这本书。

我这样说的目的不是要把书卖给你；其实在你打开这个页面的时候，这本书就已经是你的了。我是想告诉你，这本书绝对值得你抽出一些时间来读完😉。

我理解，你的时间很宝贵。所以这本书里绝对不会有任何的虚构和炒作，只会有直率且可执行的建议。

我会尽力在这本书的每一章内容里多写一些我的思考和理解。

噢对了，书都应该有个目录的吧。

来，请看目录：

## 前言：本书适合的人群

这本书适合所有正在考虑从事软件开发职位的人。

如果你打算从事一份工作时间灵活、薪资高、解决问题方式不死板的工作，软件开发职位很可能符合你的需求。

当然，学习软件开发离不开这三点：**时间**、**钱**和**机遇**。

你可能已人到中年，上有老下有小，平日空闲**时间**不多。

你可能很年轻，或许还不具备提升薪资的能力，因此还没有攒下**钱**。

或者你所在的城市技术氛围不浓，离那些着重发展科技的城市（如旧金山、柏林、东京、班加罗尔）比较远。

还有人患有残疾；有人饱受年龄、种族、性别歧视；有人因移民身份或犯罪记录四处碰壁。

对这些人来说，他们的**机遇**本身就比其他人少。

每个人的起点不同，周围环境和资源也不尽相同；学习编程和找到开发者工作对这些人来说会比其他人更困难。

但无论你的起点和资源如何，我都会尽力给出我认为适合的建议。

总之，请继续读下去，你一定会有所收获。

#### 文中涉及的专业词汇

我会尽力在提到新词的时候顺便给出定义。

有些词汇出现频率很高，比如：

“编程”（programming）和“写码”（coding）意思相同。

“应用”（app）是 application 的缩写；且这里的 app 是泛指，包括但不限于在手机、电脑、游戏主机甚至冰箱上运行的应用（译者注：作者不认为 app 是 iPhone 手机应用的专属称谓）。

“软件工程师”（software engineer）和“软件开发者”（software developer）意思相同。

技术圈的一些人对此持有不同意见，仿佛“软件工程师”这一职位已饱经沧桑，其发展史横跨几个世纪，就好像机械工程师和土木工程师一样。也许多年后你的孙辈会这么认为，但至少目前，软件开发这一领域尚处于发展初期。

以下引用一位名人说过的话：

> 如果建筑师像程序员写程序那样造房子，那么一只路过的啄木鸟就足以摧毁整个社会 —— 杰拉德·温伯格（计算机科学家、作家、大学讲师）

### 所有人都可以学习编程吗？

是的，我坚信只要驱动力足够，人人都可以学习编程。归根结底，我认为学习编程是一个与驱动力有关的挑战，而不是靠天资吃饭。

曾经，我们的祖先在广袤的非洲草原上生活了几千年，然后才迁徙到了欧洲、亚洲和美洲。那时根本没有电脑。

编程也显然不是经历了几千年发展的技术，计算机和智能手机是在 1980 - 2010 年间经历飞速发展的。

虽然我也认同天资和兴趣可以让学习编程之路走得更加顺利，但对于想从事开发者职业的人来说，我觉得花时间去练习和敲代码才是正道。

很多人是这样，他们会开始学习编程，然后遇到困难，同时感到非常受挫，进而放弃。

我也放弃过，事实上我之前因为受挫放弃了好几次。

但和那些最终成功入行的人一样，我都是在放弃后的几天调整好心情，然后重新回来接受挑战。

说了这么多，我是像告诉你：学习编程并获得一份开发者工作其实并不容易；对于一些有特殊情况的人来说更是难上加难。

我不想在这里为自己编造一个逆境翻盘的人设。我是从 30 多岁开始学习编程的，在这之前我也确实没有任何编程或计算机科学的学习经验。不过：

我在美国中产阶级的家庭里长大，我是这个家庭的第四代，而且我的母语是英语。我读过大学，我的父亲和爷爷也都读过大学；我的曾祖父（爷爷的父亲）是来自瑞典的农民。

这几代以来，我的家庭很幸运，至少我们没有受到战争、饥荒、奴隶制的影响。

因此，在我身上并没有逆境翻盘的剧本，我也不打算编造这样的故事来激励你。

如果你对这类经历感兴趣，其实开发者社区中有一些人经历过逆境翻盘，稍后我会在这本书里提到一些人，供你参考。

我不打算吹捧软件开发，也不打算为学习编程这件事情画饼，构建出一个虚幻的乌托邦。

相反地，我只会为你提供学习技术的方法建议，以及如何获得一份可以养家糊口的好工作。

如果你学习编程的目的是找一份好的、稳定的工作，那没问题。

或者你学习编程的目的是为了自己创业，那也没问题。

一些人认为，学习编程最重要的是要对编程有极大的兴趣，而且要有全身心投入学习编程的决心：就是那种甘愿辞掉自己工作，一周七天都在搞开源项目，并乐在其中。

我确实认识一些对编程有*如此*兴趣的人，但同时我也认识很多不这么硬核的人：他们在一周的劳顿后，更愿意在周末探索自然，或者和朋友玩桌游。

人都是这样，我们会更倾向于做自己擅长的事情。你会在学习写代码的过程中逐渐提升自己的编程水平，进而提升对编程的兴趣。

那么说到底，这本书的受众到底是谁？其实就是想要学习编程、并获得一份开发者工作的每个人。

无论你本身是“极客”，还是个内向的人，或者你是个理性的激进分子，你都可以学习编程。

或者你还有以上没提到的其他特质，那也无妨。这些都不会成为你学习编程道路上的绊脚石。

总之，只要你是想学好编程并通过编程赚钱的人，那这本书就是为你量身打造的。

在通读此书前，请你花一点时间读完以下的概论章节。

## 概论

学习编程本身并不容易，而想要拿到一份软件开发职位其实更难。不过对于大多数人来说，这份努力一定是值得的。

编程是高薪的、包含创新性工作的脑力劳动。职业发展路线也很明确：高级开发、技术领头人、管理岗、CTO，然后或许可以成为 CEO。

任何行业都需要软件开发。在所有软件开发职位中，非技术类公司约占 66%；这类公司包括农业、制造业、政府部门、以及像是银行和医院这样的服务业。

如果你很担心软件开发这一职业会在你退休之前被自动化工具取代，不妨这样考虑：编程本身就是在让事情自动化。因此就算将来编程可以自动化，那也不会是最先被自动化取代的职业。

如果你看到了这里，希望你和我的想法一致，认为软件开发是一份不错的职业。接下来，咱们来讨论下如何进入软件开发领域吧。

### 打造自己的技术栈

你需要学习如下内容：

- 前端开发：HTML、CSS、JavaScript
- 后端开发：SQL、Git、Linux、网页服务器
- 科学运算：Python 及其相关[库](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%87%BD%E5%BC%8F%E5%BA%AB)

以上提到的都是有 20 多年的发展史，而且发展相对成熟的领域。不论你将来为哪家公司效劳，都大概率会用到上面提到的这些技术。

学习这些东西的最好方式是做项目，最好是在学习过程中坚持一天做几个小项目。顺便，freeCodeCamp 上的课程里总共有几十个项目。

![免费学-编程-适合忙碌人士的编程课程--](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/Learn_to_Code_-_For_Free_-_Coding_Courses_for_Busy_People_--.png) freeCodeCamp 核心课程里的一些板块（Certification：认证）。

### 拓展自己的人脉

人脉广的人一般能更快找到自己想要的工作。

内向虽然不是问题，但有时候你或多或少要跳出自己的舒适圈。

不如从为自己创建 GitHub、Twitter、LinkedIn 和 Discord 账号开始吧。

尽量多参加技术会议，哪怕是需要坐火车、高铁、飞机去的那种。我建议你把学习编程的资金预算花在通勤和技术会议门票上，而不是花在购买书和课程上。

多与有识之士攀谈，认真听取他们的观点，而且记住他们的名字。

然后在 LinkedIn 上添加他们为好友，在 Twitter 上关注他们。如果你参加的技术会议有会后聚餐的安排，不要错过。

### 提升自己的圈内名声。

可以考虑为自己做的项目录制一段 demo，然后发到网上。

尝试申请成为技术会议的演讲人，越大型的会议越好。

在程序员的聊天频道里，花一些时间帮助那些比你晚入行的朋友们。

参与贡献开源项目。开源项目的开发和公司里的软件开发其实有很多相似之处。

**这些事情可以同时做，没有先后顺序。**不要拖延。

与其海投职位等结果，不如考虑多认识些人，让他们帮你内推。哪怕你认识人力资源部门的朋友，也会有帮助。

在拿到 offer 之前，不要停下面试的脚步；甚至你也可以选择不接受第一份 offer，要有耐心。

你的第一份开发职位一定是对你来说最有挑战性的。建议考虑至少做两年。别忘了，在这个过程中，你不只是在学习，还有收入。

找到工作也绝不意味着学习的终止。事实上，在公司与团队合作和维护代码都是学习的过程。

当然，身体健康一样重要。别忘了按时作息，保证睡眠和运动。

只要有足够的驱动力，任何人都可以学习编程并找到一份开发工作。

区别只是你有多想成为开发者，以及你在找工作的过程中有多坚持。

保持信念：你一定可以的！

## 谨以此书献给全球的 freeCodeCamp 参与者。

Thank you to all of you who have supported our charity and our mission over the past 8 years.

It is through your volunteerism and through your philanthropy that we've been able to help so many people learn to code and get their first developer job.

The community has grown so much from the humble open source project I first deployed in 2014. I am now just a small part of this global community.

It is a privilege to still be here, working alongside you all. Together, we face the fundamental problems of our time. Access to information. Access to education. And access to the tools that are shaping the future.

These are still early days. I have no illusion that everyone will know how to code within my lifetime. But just like the Gutenberg Bible accelerated literacy in 1455, we can continue to accelerate technology literacy through free, open learning resources.

Again, thank you all.

And special thanks to Abbey Rennemeyer for her editorial feedback, and to Estefania Cassingena Navone for designing the book cover.

And now, the book.

## Chapter 1: How to Build Your Skills

> "Every artist was first an amateur." ― Ralph Waldo Emerson

The road to knowing how to code is a long one.

For me, it was an ambiguous one.

But it doesn't have to be like that for you.

In this chapter, I'm going to share some strategies for learning to code as smoothly as possible.

First, allow me to walk you through how I learned to code back in 2011.

Then I'll share what I learned from this process.

I'll show you how to learn much more efficiently than I did.

### Story Time: How Did a Teacher in His 30s Teach Himself to Code?

I was a teacher running an English school. We had about 100 adult-aged students who had traveled to California from all around the world. They were learning advanced English so they could get into grad school.

Most of our school's teachers loved teaching. They loved hanging out with students around town, and helping them improve their conversational English.

What these teachers didn't love was paperwork: Attendance reports. Grade reports. Immigration paperwork.

I wanted our teachers to be able to spend more time with students. And less time chained to their desks doing paperwork.

But what did I know about computers?

Programming? Didn't you have to be smart to do that? I could barely configure a WiFi router. And I sucked at math.

Well one day I just pushed all that aside and thought "You know what: I'm going to give it a try. What do I have to lose?"

I started googling questions like "how to automatically click through websites." And "how to import data from websites into Excel."

I didn't realize it at the time, but I was learning how to automate workflows.

And the learning began. First with Excel macros. Then with a tool called AutoHotKey where you can program your mouse to move to certain coordinates of a screen, click around, copy text, then move to different coordinates and paste it.

After a few weeks of grasping in the dark, I figured out how to automate a few tasks. I could open an Excel spreadsheet and a website, run my script, then come back 10 minutes later and the spreadsheet would be fully populated.

It was the work of an amateur. What developers might call a "dirty hack". But it got the job done.

I used my newfound automation skills to continue streamlining the school.

Soon teachers barely had to touch a computer. I was doing the work of several teachers, just with my rudimentary skills.

This had a visible impact on the school. So much of our time had been tied up with rote work on the computer. And now we were free.

The teachers were happier. They spent more time with students.

The students were happier. They told all their friends back in their home country "you've got to check out this school."

Soon we were one of the most successful schools in the entire school system.

This further emboldened me. I remember thinking to myself: "Maybe I **can** learn to code."

I knew some software engineers from my board game night. They had traditional backgrounds, with degrees from Cal Tech, Harvey Mudd, and other famous Computer Science programs.

At the time, it was far less common for people in their 30s to learn to code.

I worked up the courage to share my dreams with some of these friends.

I wanted to learn to how program properly. I wanted to be able to write code for a living like they did. And to maybe even write software that could power schools.

I would share these dreams up with my developer friends. "I want to do what you do."

But they would sort of shrug. Then they'd say something like:

"I mean, you could try. But you're going to have to drink an entire ocean of knowledge."

And: "It's a pretty competitive field. How are you going to hang with people who grew up coding from an early age?"

And: "You're already doing fine as a teacher. Why don't you just stick with what you're good at?"

And that would knock me off course for a few weeks. I would go on long, soul-searching walks at night. I would ponder my future under the stars. Were these people right? I mean – they would know, right?

But every morning I'd be back at my desk. Watching my scripts run. Watching my reports compile themselves at superhuman speeds. Watching as my computer did my bidding.

A thought did occur to me: maybe these friends were just trying to save me from heartache. Maybe they just don't know anyone who learned to code in their 30s. So they don't think it's possible.

It's like... for years doctors thought that it would be impossible for someone to run a mile in 4 minutes. They thought your heart would explode from running so fast.

But then somebody managed to do it. And his heart did not explode.

Once Roger Bannister – a 25-year old Oxford student – broke that psychological barrier – a ton of other people did it, too. To date, more than 1,000 people have run a sub-4 minute mile.

![Roger-Bannister-1951_jpg__1269-1600_](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/Roger-Bannister-1951_jpg__1269-1600_.png)Roger Bannister running like a a champ. (Image: Britannica)

And it's not like I was doing something bold and unprecedented as running a 4 minute mile here. Plenty of famous developers have managed to teach themselves coding over the years.

Heck, Ada Lovelace taught herself programming in the 1840s. And she didn't even have a working computer. She just had an understanding of how her friend Charles Babbage's computer would work in theory.

She wrote several of the first computer algorithms. And she's widely regarded as the world's first computer programmer. Nobody taught her. Because there was nobody to teach her. Whatever self doubt she may have had, she clearly overcame it.

I was no Ada Lovelace. I was just some teacher who already had a working computer, a decent internet connection, and the ability to search through billions of webpages with Google.

I cracked my knuckles and narrowed my gaze. I was going to do this.

### Stuck in Tutorial Hell

> "If you work for 10 years, do you get 10 years of experience or do you get 1 year of experience 10 times? You have to reflect on your activities to get true experience. If you make learning a continuous commitment, you’ll get experience. If you don’t, you won’t, no matter how many years you have under your belt." – Steve McConnell, Software Engineer

I spent the next few weeks googling around, and doing random tutorials that I encountered online.

Oh look, a Ruby tutorial.

Uh-oh, it's starting to get hard. I'm getting error messages not mentioned in the tutorial. Hm... what's going on here...

Oh look, a Python tutorial.

Human psychology is a funny thing. The moment something starts to get hard, we ask: am I doing this right?

Maybe this tutorial is out of date. Maybe its author didn't know what they were talking about. Does anybody even still use this programming language?

When you're facing the ambiguous error messages hours into a coding session, the grass on the other side starts to look a lot greener.

It was easy to pretend I'd made progress. Time to go grab lunch.

I'd see a friend at the café. "How's your coding going?" they'd ask.

"It's going great. I already coded 4 hours today."

"Awesome. I'd love to see what you're building sometime."

"Sure thing," I'd say, knowing that I'd built nothing. "Soon."

Maybe I'd go to the book store and get a new JavaScript book.

Buying books is the best feeling in the world. Because it also feels like you're buying the time to read them.

And this is precisely where I found myself a few weeks into learning to code.

I had read the first 100 pages of several programming books, but finished none.

I had written the first 100 lines of code from several programming tutorials, but finished none.

I didn't know it, but I was trapped in place that developers lovingly call "tutorial hell."

Tutorial hell is where you jump from one tutorial to the next, learning and then relearning the same basic things. But never really going beyond the fundamentals.

Because going beyond the fundamentals – that requires some real work.

### It Takes a Village to Raise a Coder

Learning to code was absorbing all of my free time. But I wasn't making much progress. I could now type the `{` and `*` characters without looking at the keyboard. But that was about it.

I knew I needed help. Perhaps some Yoda-like mentor, who could teach me the ways. Yes – if such a person existed, surely that would make all the difference.

I found out about a nearby place called a "hackerspace." When I first heard the name, I was a bit apprehensive. Don't hackers do illegal things? I was an English teacher who liked playing board games. I was not looking for trouble.

Well I called the number listed and talked with a guy named Steve. I nervously asked: "You all don't do anything illegal, do you?" And Steve laughed.

It turns out the word "hack" is what he called an overloaded term. Yes – "to hack" can mean to maliciously break into a software system. But "to hack" can also mean something more mundane: to write computer code.

Something can be "hacky" meaning it's not an elegant solution. And yet you can have "a clever hack" – an ingenious trick to make your code work more efficiently.

In short: don't be scared of the term "hack."

![1200x-1_jpg__1200-797_](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/1200x-1_jpg__1200-797_.png)Facebook's corporate campus has the word "hack" written in giant letter on the concrete. (Image: Bloomberg)

I, for one, scarcely use the term because it's so confusing. And I think recently a lot of hackerspaces have picked up on the ambiguity. Many of them now call themselves "makerspaces" instead.

Because that's what a hackerspace is all about – making things.

Steve invited me to visit the hackerspace on Saturday afternoon. He said several developers from the area would be there.

The first time I walked through the doors of the Santa Barbara Hackerspace, I was blown away.

The place smelled like an electric fire. Its makeshift tables were lined with soldering irons, strips of LED lights, hobbyist Arduino circuit boards, and piles of Roomba vacuum robots.

The same Steve I'd spoken to on the phone was there, and he greeted me. He had glasses, slicked back hair, and a goatee beard. He was always smiling. And when you asked him a question, instead of responding quickly, he would nod and think for a few seconds first.

Steve was a passionate programmer who had studied math and philosophy at the University of California – Santa Barbara. He was still passionate about those subjects. But his real passion was Python.

Steve turned on the projector and gave an informal "lightning talk." He was demoing an app he'd written that would recognize QR codes in a video and replace them with images.

Someone in the audience pulled up a QR code on their laptop and held it in front of the camera. Steve's app then replaced the QR code with a picture of a pizza.

Somebody in the audience shouted, "Can you make the pizza spin?"

Steve opened up his code in a code editor called Emacs, and started making changes to it in real time. He effortlessly tabbed between his code editor, his command line, and the browser the app was running in, "hot loading" updates to the code.

For me, this was sorcery. I couldn't believe Steve had just busted out that app over the course of few hours. And now he was adding new features on the fly, as the audience requested them.

I thought: "This guy is a genius."

And that evening, after the event ended, he and I stayed after and I told him so.

We ate sandwiches together. And I said to him: "I could code for my entire career and not be as good as you. I would be thrilled if after 10 years I could code even half as well as you."

But Steve pushed back. He said, "I'm nothing special. Don't limit yourself. If you stick with coding, you could easily surpass me."

I didn't for a second believe the words he said to me. But just the fact that he said it gave me butterflies.

Here he was: a developer who believed in me. He saw me – some random teacher – the very definition of a "script kiddie" – and thought I could make it.

Steve and I talked late into the night. He showed me his $200 netbook computer, which even by 2011 standards was woefully underpowered.

"You don't need a powerful computer to build software," Steve told me. "Today's hardware is incredibly powerful. Computers are only slow because the bloated software they run makes them slow. Get an off-the-shelf laptop, wipe the hard drive, install Linux on it, and start coding."

I took note of the model of laptop he had and ordered the exact same one when I got home that night.

After a few days of debugging my new computer with Stack Overflow, I successfully installed Ubuntu. I started learning how to use the Emacs code editor. By the following Saturday, I knew a few commands, and was quick to show them off.

Steve nodded in approval. He said, "Awesome. But what are you building?"

I didn't understand what he meant. "I'm learning how to use Emacs. Check it out. I memorized..."

But Steve looked pensive. "That's cool and all. But you need a project. Always have a project. Then learn what you need to learn en route to finishing that project."

我除了帮助学校的老师写的几个脚本之外，我从来没有完成过任何东西。但我开始明白他所说的是什么意思。

这一刻我恍然大悟了。一直以来，我都被困在教程的地狱里，兜兜转转，什么也没完成。

史蒂夫说："我希望你用HTML5建立一个项目。下周六，我希望你在黑客空间（hackerspace）展示它。"

听到他的话，我感到很羞愧。但我站直了身子，对他说： "这个计划听起来不错。我这就开始做。"

### 除了你，没有人可以让你成为一个开发者

> "我试着解放你的心灵，尼奥。 但我只能带你到门口，你必须自己走过去。" （莫斐斯，1999年电影《黑客帝国》） 

第二天早上，我在上班前起得特别早，在网上搜索 "HTML5教程 "之类的东西。在之前的教程地狱中，我已经了解了很多相关知识。我没有跳过，而是放慢脚步，准确地跟着教程走，输入每一条命令。

通常情况下，一旦我完成一个教程，我就会去找另一个教程。但是，我却开始玩起了教程中的代码。我对自己想做的项目有了初步的想法，我打算制作一个纯HTML5的文档页面。

\---

如果你不知道什么是HTML5，让我快速地解释一下。它只是HTML的一个较新的版本，从20世纪90年代的第一个网页开始，它就已经存在了。

如果一个网站是一个身体，那么HTML就是骨头。其他一切都建立在这些骨骼之上。(你可以把JavaScript看作是肌肉，把CSS看作是皮肤）。

让我们重新回到故事上来。

\---

我已经知道在HTML中，你可以通过使用ID属性链接到同一个网页的不同部分。所以我想：如果我沿着左手边放一个目录会怎么样？点击左边的不同选项（item），右边的页面就会相应地滚动并显示这些项目。

半个小时内，我就编出了一个粗略的原型。

但是又到了去学校报到的时间了，我只好中断编程。整整一天，我所想的都是我的项目，以及我应该如何最好地完成它。 

我飞快地跑回家，打开我的笔记本电脑，花了整整一个晚上来编码。

我把官方和使用创作共用许可证 （Creative Commons license）的HTML文档直接复制到我的页面，把它 "硬编码 "到HTML中。

然后，我花了大约一个小时的时间在CSS上，让所有东西看起来都是正确的，并使用绝对定位来保持侧边栏的位置。

我尽可能多地使用了HTML5的新 "语义 "标签。

轰--项目完成了。 

一股成就感涌上心头。我慢跑到附近的一个足球场，绕着球场跑了几圈，庆祝一下。我成功了，我完成了一个项目。 

我当时就决定：从现在开始，我所做的一切都将成为一个项目。我将努力使它成为一个完成品。

第二天晚上，我走到讲台上，插上我的笔记本电脑，展示了我的HTML5网页。我回答了在场的开发者们关于HTML5的问题。

有时我会弄错一些东西，这时我会听到听众说，"这听起来不对--让我查查文档"。

人们并不害怕纠正我。但他们都很有礼貌，而且乐于提供支持。我甚至不觉得他们在纠正我，感觉他们比较像是在纠正公共记录，以免有人带着错误的信息离开。

我没有感到任何可能在在职教师会议上发表演讲的焦虑。

相反地，我几乎觉得自己是观众的一部分，与他们一起学习。

毕竟，这些都是新兴的开发工具。我们都在努力了解如何使用它们。 

我的演讲结束后，史蒂夫走过来对我说："还不错"。

我尴尬地笑了很久，没有说什么，只是对自己很满意。

然后史蒂夫眯着眼睛，抿起嘴。他说： "今晚开始你的下一个项目"。


### 我的编码之旅的经验教训

我们会在接下来的每一章中查看小昆西的编码之旅。但现在我想把这里的一些教训分解一下。我还想回答你可能有的一些问题。


### 为什么学习编码如此困难？

学习任何新技能都是困难的。无论是运球，还是给汽车换油，或是说一门新的语言。

有几个特别的原因让学习代码如此困难，而其中一些是编码所特有的。

第一个原因是，大多数人不明白编码到底是什么。那么，我这就来告诉你。


### 什么是编码？

编码是用计算机能理解的方式告诉计算机要做什么。

所谓的编码就仅仅是这样而已。 

但你不要搞错了，与计算机沟通是很难的。按照人类的标准，它们很 "愚蠢"。它们会完全按照你的要求去做，但除非你擅长编码，否则它们可能不会做你“想”让它们做的事。 

你可能在想：那服务器呢？数据库呢？网络呢？

归根结底，这些都是由一层层的软件控制的，而这些软件都是由代码所组成。从最上层

一路往下都是代码所构成的，直到抵达最底层的物理硬件，也就是在电路板上移动的电子。

在计算机发展最初的几十年里，开发人员编写的代码是 "接近金属 "的，意思是他们通常是直接在硬件上操作，将比特从0翻转到1，再翻转回来。

但是，当代的软件开发涉及许多 "抽象层"——一个程序运行在另外的程序之上，仅仅几行JavaScript代码就可以完成一些非常强大的事情。

在20世纪60年代，一个 "bug" （虫子，也有程序错误的意思）可能是一只昆虫在一个房间大小的计算机中爬来爬去，并在其中一个电路中被烧毁。

 1945 年发现的史上第一个计算机虫子是一只飞蛾，它被困在哈佛大学一个房间大小的计算机的面板中。  (图片：Public Domain)

今天，我们编写的代码比物理硬件高出了许多抽象层。

这就是编码。它比过去要容易得多。而且它每年都在变得更加容易。

不夸张地说，几十年后，编码将变得如此简单和普遍，以至于大多数年轻人都会知道如何编码。


## 为什么即使在2023年，学习编码仍然很难？

 即使在2023年，学习编码也是如此困难，有三大原因。

1. 工具仍然很原始

2. 大多数人不善于处理模棱两可的问题，而学习编码面对的就是这样的问题。人们常会迷失方向。

3. 大多数人不善于处理持续的负面反馈，而学习编码常常会收到一个又一个残酷的错误信息，会使人感到沮丧。

现在我将更详细地一一讨论这些困难。我还会教你一些实用的策略来克服每一项困难。


### 工具仍然是原始的

![tng-s4e19-171](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/TNG-S4E19-171.jpeg)

 来自《星际迷航：下一代》着魔似的巴克利（Barclay）在全息甲板（Holodeck）上编程

>   "计算机，开始新的程序，创建如下：工作站的椅子，现在创建一个标准的字母数字控制台，定位在左手；现在为右手创建一个标志性的显示控制台。将这两个控制台与企业主计算机核心相连，利用神经扫描界面。" ——巴克利，来自《星际迷航：下一代》第四季第19集："第N度"

上面我拿了我最喜欢的科幻电视剧《星际迷航：下一代》中的一段作为例子，告诉你这就是人们在未来可能的编程方式。

《星际迷航》中的每个角色都会编码。医生、保安人员、飞行员，甚至小韦斯利-克鲁舍（Wesley Crusher，由儿童演员威尔-惠顿扮演）也能让飞船上的计算机听从他的命令。

当然，每个人都会编码的原因之一是他们生活在一个后稀缺的24世纪社会，可以获得免费的高质量教育。

另一个原因是，在未来，编码会容易得多。你只需准确地告诉计算机要做什么，然后，如果你足够精确，计算机就会执行。 

如果编程就像用简单的英语对计算机说指令一样容易呢？

我们已经朝着这个目标取得了重大进展。想一想以前我们的祖母，她们在房间大小的大型计算机和成堆的打孔卡（punch cards）之间奔波。 

![naca-computer-operates-an-ibm-telereader-5b6f9f-1024](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/naca-computer-operates-an-ibm-telereader-5b6f9f-1024.jpeg)
20世纪50年代使用打卡机的计算机（图片：NASA）

过去，即使是一个简单的应用程序的编程也需要严谨的指令。

这里有两个 "凯撒密码 "（Cesar Cypher）的例子，这是经典的计算机科学家庭作业项目。

这也被称为 "ROT-13"，因为你将字母ROT了13个位置。例如，A变成N（A后13个字母），B变成O（B后13个字母）。 

我将向你展示这个程序的两个例子，这两个例子都来自创作共用许可证的罗塞塔代码（Rosetta Code）项目。 

首先，这是x86汇编中的程序：

```x86
format 	ELF 	executable 3
entry 	start
	
segment	readable writeable
buf	rb	1
	
segment	readable executable
start:	mov	eax, 3		; syscall "read"
	mov	ebx, 0		; stdin
	mov	ecx, buf	; buffer for read byte
	mov	edx, 1		; len (read one byte)
	int	80h

	cmp	eax, 0		; EOF?
	jz	exit

	xor 	eax, eax	; load read char to eax
	mov	al, [buf]
	cmp	eax, "A"	; see if it is in ascii a-z or A-Z
	jl	print
	cmp	eax, "z"
	jg	print
	cmp	eax, "Z"
	jle	rotup
	cmp	eax, "a"
	jge	rotlow
	jmp	print

rotup:	sub	eax, "A"-13	; do rot 13 for A-Z
	cdq
	mov	ebx, 26
	div	ebx
	add	edx, "A"
	jmp	rotend
	
rotlow:	sub	eax, "a"-13	; do rot 13 for a-z
	cdq
	mov	ebx, 26
	div	ebx
	add	edx, "a"

rotend:	mov	[buf], dl
	
print: 	mov	eax, 4		; syscall write
	mov	ebx, 1		; stdout
	mov	ecx, buf	; *char
	mov	edx, 1		; string length
	int	80h

	jmp	start

exit: 	mov     eax,1		; syscall exit
	xor     ebx,ebx		; exit code
	int     80h
```

下面是Python中的同一程序:

```python
import string

TRANSLATION_TABLE = str.maketrans(
    string.ascii_uppercase + string.ascii_lowercase,
    string.ascii_uppercase[13:] + string.ascii_uppercase[:13] +
    string.ascii_lowercase[13:] + string.ascii_lowercase[:13]
)


def rot13(s):
    """Return the rot-13 encoding of s."""
    return s.translate(TRANSLATION_TABLE)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    """rot-13 encode the input files, or stdin if no files are provided."""
    import fileinput
    for line in fileinput.input():
        print(rot13(line), end="")
```

更简单，更容易阅读，对吗？

 而在未来，编码将像对你的宇宙飞船说的那样简单。

"计算机，开始新程序。把我说的每一个字母，替换成英语字母表中13个位置之后出现的字母，然后将结果读回给我。这个词就是 "香蕉"。

然后你的电脑会说： "Onanan"。

我们正在做的事情被称为 "声明式编程" （declarative programming）。我们在宣布 "计算机，你应该这样做"。而计算机足够聪明（编程足够好），能够理解我们的指令并执行它们。

在2023的今天，我们大多数正在使用的代码风格就是“命令性编程”。我们一步步地告诉计算机，我们要做什么。

计算机很呆，所以我们必须帮它们把一只脚放在另一只脚前面，以让它知道怎么走路。

现在，这个领域尚未成熟。

人类早期的工具是从石头到青铜再到铁，同样的事情也发生在软件工具上，不过速度要快得多。

我们现在可能处于相当于青铜时代的编程阶段。但在我们的有生之年，我们可能会达到铁器时代。

### 学习编程是一个模糊的过程

学习编程的时候，你可能经常会问自己：“我这样花时间干这个事儿正确吗？我现在学的是正确的工具吗？这些书的作者和课程制作者真的知道他们自己在说什么吗？”

模糊性会迷惑你的每一次学习。“我的测试案例失败是因为教程过时了，而且我使用的框架发生了重大变化？还是我只是做错了？”

正如我之前在《教程地狱》中提到的，你还得应对“这山望着那山高”的问题。

很多开发者在面临这个问题的解答时，都会用一个他们自认为很聪明的“RTFM”原则作为答案，即“Read the Freaking Manual（直接啃说明书）”。但是这个答案也并不是那么有用，甚至会让问题变得更加复杂，该读哪本说明书？读哪个章节？

另一个问题是：你没有清晰的了解你不知道的事情，以至于你往往不能清楚地表达出你想问的问题。

如果你连问出正确的问题都做不到，那么得到正确的答案更是异想天开，你会被学习过程折磨得很惨。

这会让编程这件事变得格外苦难，因为在你做这个软件之前，很大几率没人试着做过和你这个完全相同的软件。

因此，你在过程中遇到的问题大概率是前所未有的，而且可能没有人可以帮你。

人们每天在谷歌上输入的查询中，有15%是以前从未被搜索过的。如果你正在搜索的内容是这15里的东西，那可能有点不妙。

我的理论是：大多数开发人员会想出如何解决一个问题，然后简单地继续前进，而不会把它记录在任何地方，因此，你可能是少数不得不为相同的问题找出自己的解决方案的开发者之一。

然后，当然我们还有很多古老的论坛主题和Stackflow页面。

<figure class="kg-card kg-card-image kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/wisdom_of_the_ancients_png__485-270_.png" alt="来自XKCD的绘画" class="kg-image"><figcaption>来自XKCD的绘画</figcaption></figure>

### 如何在学习编程的时候不迷失方向

好消息是：当你练习多了以后， **能力** 和 **自信** 都会随之而来。

很快你就会知道在Google上搜什么了。对于文档通常是如何组织的，以及在哪里寻找目标信息，你很快就会有第二直觉，而且你也会知道该在哪里问哪些问题。

我希望这些含糊不清的问题都能有一个简单的答案，但是你不得不承认，学习编程就是一个含糊不清的过程。而且即使是有经验的开发者也会为模棱两可的问题而烦恼。

毕竟，在编程时，你可以无限地重复使用你以前遇到的问题的解决方案，就职业内容这方面来说，编程是一份稀有的职业。

因此，作为一名开发者，你总是在做一些你以前从未做过的事情。

人们总是认为软件开发就是把代码输进电脑里，但这实际上是在学习。

在你的职业生涯中，你会花很大一部分时间去认真思考。又或是盲目地将命令输入提示符，试图了解一个系统是如何运作的。

而且你会花很长时间跟别人开会，比如管理者、顾客、开发者同事。学习需要解决的问题，这样你就可以建立一个解决方案。

适应这种模糊的感觉，你就会走得更远。

### 编程是在一个又一个的错误信息中学习的

很多学习编程的人有时感觉像是撞到了墙上，因为进展并不像他们期待中的那么快。

一个很大的原因是：编程的反馈比回路要比其他领域紧密的多。

在很多学校里，你的老师会给你布置一些作业，然后给它们打分之后再返回给你。在一个学期里，你可能只有十几次得到反馈的机会。

你可能会对自己自言自语道：“完了，那门课的考试考砸了，期中考试之前得好好学习了。”

或许你老师会在你的书卷上用红笔标出要点，来帮助你改善工作。

在考试或试卷上得到一个糟糕的成绩真的会让人心情糟糕一整天。

而这一般就是我们作为人类对反馈的思考方式。

如果你花时间在编程上，你会知道电脑是很快的，他们可以在毫秒内将你的代码执行完毕。

大多数情况下你的代码会崩溃。

如果你比较幸运的话，你会得到一个错误信息。

而如果你足够幸运的话，你会得到一个“堆栈记录”以及导致程序崩溃的那一行代码，堆栈记录指的是当计算机遇到错误时试图做的一切操作。

<figure class="kg-card kg-card-image kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/oh-my-zsh-stack-trace-error.jpg" alt="在本地运行freeCodeCamp时的堆栈跟踪错误信息" class="kg-image"><figcaption>在本地运行freeCodeCamp时的堆栈跟踪错误信息</figcaption></figure>

上面就是来自电脑的当面的负面反馈，不是每个人都能接受整天看到这种情况。

想象一下，如果每次你把你的学期论文交给老师，他们都会把大红的"F"写在上面。再想象一下，在你还没来得及眨眼的时候，他们就这样做了。一遍又一遍。

编码有时就是这种感觉，你想抓住电脑，然后不停地质问它："你为什么就是不懂我？"

### 怎样才能不感到沮丧

再重复一遍，关键是练习。

随着时间的推移，你会对模糊的错误信息和像屏幕一样长的堆栈记录形成一种容忍。

编程永远不会比你刚开始的时候更难。

你不仅不知道自己在做什么，而且你也不习惯接受这种不近人情的、快速的、负面的反馈。

所以这里有一些小建议：

#### Tip #1：明确自己在这方面并不是独一无二的糟糕。

每个学习代码的人都会为试图与计算机进行Vulcan心灵融合并让它理解你而感到沮丧。(这是另一个来自《星际迷航》的参考资料）。

当然，很多人在他们是孩子的时候就开始编程了。他们会表现得像他们一直很擅长编程，但他们很可能像我们成年人一样挣扎，随着时间的推移，他们只是忘记了那几个小时的挫折。

把电脑看作你的朋友，而不是对手，电脑有什么错，它只是想让你把自己的指令明确一些罢了。

#### Tip #2：呼吸。

很多人在面对错误信息的时候，本能反应都是咬牙切齿。然后重新在代码编辑器中盲目的修改代码，希望以某种幸运的方式通过这个问题。

这样是行不通的，下面是为什么这么说。

宇宙是很复杂的。软件也是很复杂的。你不太可能仅仅通过"阿甘正传"的方式获得任何好处。

<figure class="kg-card kg-card-image kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/gump.jpeg" alt="阿甘做他该做的事，并以不寻常的运气抓到了虾子" class="kg-image"><figcaption>阿甘做他该做的事，并以不寻常的运气抓到了虾子</figcaption></figure>

你可能听说过"无限猴子定理"。这是一个思想实验，实验内容是让你想象黑猩猩在打字机上打字。

如果你有一个新闻编辑室，里面都是黑猩猩在做这件事，要多久才会有一只黑猩猩随机打出"to be or not to be"这句话？

假设每只黑猩猩每秒钟打一个随机字符。他们中的一个可能需要1万亿年的时间来输入"to be or not to be"，那是10的18次方，十亿亿。

即使假设黑猩猩保持健康，打字机定期维修，当它们中的一个设法打出"to be or not to be"时，银河系将是一个寒冷、黑暗的虚空。

我为什么要告诉你这一切？因为你不希望成为那些黑猩猩中的一员。

在这段时间里，你几乎肯定可以想出办法来教那些黑猩猩如何打英文单词。它们可能会设法打出《哈姆雷特》的全部内容，而不仅仅是其中最著名的一句。

即使你真的很幸运，通过了这个bug，你会学到什么？

因此，与其惊慌失措，不如花些时间，理解代码，理解正在发生的事情，然后修复错误。

务必花时间去理解错误的代码，不要成为一个quintillionarian(五亿年)的黑猩猩。(我认为quintillionarian意味着一个五亿岁的人，虽然根据谷歌，以前没有人用过这个词）。

与其盲目地尝试，寄希望于简单地跳过错误信息，不如放慢速度。

深吸一口气，伸个懒腰，起身去拿一杯热饮。

未来的自己会感谢你把这作为一个有教育意义的时刻。

#### Tip #3：使用“橡皮鸭”调试

找一只橡皮鸭子，把它放在你的电脑旁边。每当你遇到错误信息时，试着解释一下你认为你的橡皮鸭发生了什么。

当然，这是很蠢的，这怎么可能有帮助呢？

除非真的有帮助。

“橡皮鸭调试”对于让自己慢下来、尝试专注于眼前的工作是很有帮助的。

当然，你不一定要用橡皮鸭子。你可以向你的宠物仙人掌解释你的Python应用程序，解释你的SQL查询给那只一直跳到你键盘上的猫。

大声解释你的想法似乎能帮助你更好地处理这一情况。

### 大多数人是怎么学习编程的呢？

现在让我们来谈谈通往第一份开发者工作的传统途径。

为什么要在意别人是怎么做的呢？剧透警告：没必要。

做好自己的事情就可以了。

这就是说，你可能会怀疑自己和你对学习所做的决定，你可能会向往没有走过的路。

我在这一部分的目标是安抚你可能有的任何焦虑。

#### 计算机科学学位的重要性

大学学位对于准备从事软件开发职业的人来说仍然是一个黄金标准，尤其是计算机科学的学士学位。

在你开始说“但我没有计算机科学学位”之前，不用担心，**你不需要计算机科学学位就能成为一名开发人员**。

但它们的用处是不可否认的，下面将解释原因。

首先，你会想“为什么开发者需要学习计算机科学？”，毕竟，有史以来最著名的开发者之一对该领域有这样的评价：

> “计算机科学教育不能使任何人成为专家级的程序员，就像研究画笔和颜料不会让人成为专家级的画家一样。” - Eric Raymond，开发人员、计算机科学家和作家。

计算机科学系在传统上是数学系的一部分，20世纪60年代和70年代的大学不知道该把整个计算机的事情放在哪里。

在其他大学，计算机科学被认为是电气工程的延伸。直到最近，即使是加州大学伯克利分校--世界上最伟大的公立大学之一--也只提供计算机科学学位，作为电气工程的一种双主修课程。

但大多数大学现在已经开始了解计算机科学作为一个研究领域的重要性。

截至本文写作时，计算机科学是你能得到的报酬最高的学位，甚至高于专注于金钱的领域，如金融和经济学。

[根据Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/50-highest-paying-college-majors/), 美国的计算机科学专业平均在第一份工作中比其他专业赚得更多。70000美刀对一个刚从大学毕业的人来说是一笔不小的收入。

高于护理专业（59000美元）、金融专业（55000美元）和建筑专业（50000美元）。

OK--所以获得计算机科学学位可以帮助你找到一份高薪的入门工作。这可能对任何人都不是新闻，但这是为什么呢？

#### 雇主如何看待学士学位的问题

你可能已经听到科技界的一些大雇主说，“我们不再要求求职者有学士学位”之类的话。

谷歌这么说过，苹果也这么说过。

而且我相信他们，他们不再需要本科学位。

我们已经有很多freeCodeCamp的校友在这些公司找到了工作，其中有些人没有相应的学士学位。

但那些找到这些工作的freeCodeCamp校友可能必须是特别强的候选人，以克服他们没有学士学位的事实。

你可以看一下这些职位空缺，他们判断候选人的标准有很多：

1. 工作经验
2. 教育
3. 投资组合和项目
4. 他们是否有已经在该公司工作的人的推荐？(我们将在第二章深入讨论建立你的网络）
5. 其他声誉方面的考虑（我们将在第三章中讨论建立你的声誉。）

对于这些不要求学士学位的雇主来说，教育只是几个考虑因素中的一个。如果你在其他方面比较强，他们可能会选择面试你--不管你是否曾经踏入过大学的教室。

只需注意，拥有学士学位将使你更容易获得面试机会，即使在这些 "可选择学位 "的雇主那里。

#### 为什么那么多开发者的岗位特别要求有计算机科学的学位呢？

我经常告诉人们，学士就是学士。因为就大多数意图和目的而言，它是有用的。

想进入美国军队成为一名军官，而不是一名士兵？你将需要一个学士学位，但任何专业都可以。

想获得工作签证到国外工作吗？你可能需要一个本科学位，但任何专业都可以。

而对于许多写着“需要学士学位”的职位空缺--任何专业都可以。

这是为什么呢？你在大学里学习的科目难道一点都不重要吗？

我的理论是这样的：你在大学里学了什么没有你**是否**完成大学学业重要。

雇主倾向于选择通过自己的方式完成大学学业的人。

你当然可以成绩垫底，一直挂科和花一半的大学时光缓考，但是学位就是学位。

你知道以最后一名的成绩毕业于医学院的学生被称作什么吗？“医生”。

对于大部分雇主来说，就是这样的道理。

多数情况下，HR只是通过招聘过滤软件的勾选框来筛选简历，过滤掉没有学位的应聘人员。他们可能完全没看过这些被筛选掉的简历。

必须强调，并不是所有HR都这样。但大多数HR都这样，在美国如此，其他国家可能更为严重。

这很糟糕，但这就是劳动力市场目前的状况，在几十年后可能会好转也可能没有变化。

这就是为什么我总是鼓励十几二十多岁的年轻人认真考虑获得一个学士学位。

并不是为了大学本身：

- 教育本身。（你可以在线免费学习世界上最好大学的课程，所以这并不构成高额学费的充分理由）
- 如宿舍生活、交友、自我探索等“大学经验”。（美国学生基本不住在学校，也就没有类似的经验）
- 通识课程帮助你成为“全面人才”(听说过[“Freshman 15”](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/freshman-15)（大一胖三斤半）这个笑话吗?但确实有很多大一新生过劳肥)

再次申明，学士学位真正的意义（美国人花十万美元甚至更多来支付大学4年的学费）是因为雇主要求学历。

当然，获得学士学位还有其他的好处，如：更多从军的选择、更容易获得工作签证等。

还有一个好处是：如果你想要成为一名医生、牙医或者教授，你必须先拥有学士学位。然后再进入研究生院。

已经铺垫地差不多了，让我直言不讳地回答你的问题。

### 成为一个软件工程师需要大学学历吗?

不需要。很多雇主都不需要你有学士学位。

但学士学位可以帮助你更快获得面试机会，获得更高的工资。

### 那[副学士（Associate degree)文凭](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%89%AF%E5%AD%B8%E5%A3%AB)(相当于中国的大专）呢？有含金量吗？

理论上是的。在科技行业的某些领域的确需要副学士文凭，这个文凭也会帮助你更快获得面试机会。

虽然如此，我不鼓励你为了副学士文凭而去读大学。我更鼓励你待够4年，拿到大学文凭，这个的含金量更高。

美国教育部的数据显示，在整个职业生涯中，大学学历的薪资比副学士学历高31%。

这两种学历的区别可比普通本科以及计算机科学本科的区别要大得多。

### 如果没有大学学历，过了年龄还申请学士学位值得吗？

假设你三十多岁，你参加过一些学院和大学的课程，并且你已经完成了头两年的学业可以获得副学士学位。

“重返校园”值得吗？

是的，重返校园值得！

但我并不认为你应该辞掉工作脱产学习。

脱产学习是为“传统”学生设计的。他们通常在18到22岁之间（如果服过兵役可能年龄稍长一些），除了高中校外打工和暑期实习，并未有任何工作经验。

传统的大学的学费高昂，一般学生会结合奖学金、家庭基金和学生贷款来支付。

作为一个工作了的成年人，你获得这些现金资助的渠道更少。与此同时，你也没有一个刚毕业的高中生时间宽裕。

但这并不意味着你就要放弃获得学士学位的梦想了。

与其加入一个传统大学，我更推荐三十岁以上的成年人参与线上非盈利大学。有两所名声在外、收费合理的大学：西部州长大学（ Western Governor's University）和美国人民大学（ University of the People）。

一些本地社区大学和州立大学的衍生项目也提供学位。许多项目都是线上的，其中一部分还可以自己管理学习进度，你可以根据自己的工作安排完成学业的时间。

做好研究功课。如果一个大学看上去不错，推荐你使用LinkedIn找到该学校校友，向他们寻求帮助。询问他们的经验，他们觉得这些课程是否物有所值。

我不推荐通过借贷的方式来获得学位。去一个学费没那么贵的学校更好。学位只是一个学位而已，只要是来自一个授权的机构，基本上就可以服务于你需要用学位达成的大部分目的。

### 如果你已经有学士学位，有必要再回到校园，读一个计算机科学专业吗？

没有必要，既浪费钱又浪费时间！

如果你已经拥有学士学位– 即便和科学、科技、工程、数学（non-STEM）无关 – 你已经获得大学能提供的大部分价值了。

### 那计算机科学的研究生学历呢?

这对职业进阶有助益，但你可以在已经有开发者工作经验之后再去申请。

许多雇主会支付员工继续教育的学费。

我技术领域的很多伙伴都参加了佐治亚理工学院的计算机科学研究生的课程。

佐治亚理工学院的计算机科学部不仅仅在全美数一数二，而且其研究生学位完全线上，费用也合理。

但我不鼓励你现在就去申请，先找一份开发者工作。（本书之后的章节会详细介绍）

### 未来学位还会这么重要吗？

是的，我认为学士学位会在未来几十年，甚至是几百年依旧保持重要的地位。

学士学位已经存在超过1000年了。

许多美国顶尖学校比美国历史还悠久。(哈佛有400年历史)

学士学位的消亡这一说法实属夸大。

一些圈子开始抨击大学，倡导学位无用论。

当如果你查看相关数据，会发现事实并非如此。学位和薪资息息相关。

同时，一个学位也可以帮助你获得更安全、稳定以及更有成就感的工作。

当然，你也可以通过做甲板工，为石油钻井服务赚得丰厚的收入。

但你也可以作为一个开发人员，在恒温的办公环境，通过维护服务器、修补代码库赚钱同样丰厚的收入。

前者工作环境危险，对背部有损伤；而后者工作环境舒适，即便是40岁，你也可以继续工作下去。

许多抨击大学的“意见领袖”本身从自己的大学学历获益。

我认为倡导“大学无用论”的其中一个理由是：很难将学习与获得地位提升联系起来。

大学只是阶级信号的一种形式吗 – 即富裕阶级将财富传承到下一代的一种方式？总体来说，在哈佛找到一位富家子弟比穷苦学子的概率要大20倍。

事实是：人生的本质就是不公平。但这并不改变劳动力市场的运行规律。

你可以选择简单模式，完成学位，并且在职业道路上获得更多机会。

或者是困难模式，省下一些时间和金钱，但是需要更谨慎地选择雇主。

我的许多朋友在获取成功的路上两种模式切换使用。

### 计算机科学学士学位包含哪些内容?

### 大学学历的替代品有哪些?

我已经在成人教育领域耕耘了二十多年，我看到了许多大学学历的替代品。

当然包含一些认证项目和集训班（bootcamp）。

雇主并不认可这些的含金量，而且它们很少要求严格。

*旁注：当我说 "认证项目 "时，我指的是你参加一个课程，然后在最后获得一个证书。这些项目的价值有限。但是来自亚马逊和微软等公司的基于考试的认证是相当有价值的。我们将在后面更深入地讨论这些。*

我常常告诉人们：到底去不去攻读学位，这是一个问题。

我遇到过很多没有学士学位的人，他们是汽车修理工、电工或从事其他行业的人。他们可以清楚地学会一套技能，应用它，并保住一份工作。

我遇到过很多没有学士学位的簿记员、律师助理和其他“知识工作者”。他们可以清楚地学会一套技能，应用它，并保住一份工作。

这些人可以自学代码，使用免费的学习资源并与志同道合的人交流。

其中一些人的个人目标一直是回去完成他们的学士学位。这是攻读学位的一个很好的理由。

但不适用于每一个人。

如果你想要获得正规教育，你可以去攻读学士学位；如果你不想，别参与这些项目。自学就可以。

培训班和认证项目仅给你提供课程大纲和同学间的竞争压力。这并不赖，但值得你花上千美元吗？

### 如何自学代码

大部分开发者都是自学的，即便是有相关学历的程序员也在Stack Overflow的年度调查中宣称自己是“自学”。

![stack-overflow](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/stack-overflow.jpeg)大部分在职程序员认为自己的“自学的” (图片来源: Stack Overflow 2016 调查)

因为代码需要终生学习。不断有新的工具需要学习，新的过气代码需要重新规划，新的问题需要解决。

所以不论你是否接受了正规教育，你都要知道：你必须擅长自学。

#### “自学”开发意味着什么?

但当我提到自学时，我指的是自主学习——在正规教育之外学习。

很少有人在任何事情上都是真正“自学成才”的。例如，艾萨克·牛顿自学了微积分，因为当时没有微积分书籍。他必须边做边弄明白并发明它。

同样地，爱达·勒芙蕾丝自学了编程。因为在她之前，没有编程。她发明了它。

有人可能会告诉你：“你不是真正的自学，因为你是从书本或在线课程中学习的。所以你有老师。”它们是正确的，但只是在最狭义的意义上。

如果有人对你自称是自学成才提出异议，只需说：“按照你的标准，只要不是被狼养大的，就不能声称自己是自学成才的。”

将本书的这一部分指给他们看，并告诉他们：“Quincy预料到了你的傲慢。”然后继续你的生活。

人生苦短，别浪费时间。

你就是自学成才的！

#### 什么是自主学习?

作为自学者，你将整理自己的学习资源。选择从哪里学习什么。这就是“自主学习”的本质。

但是你怎么知道你学习正确的技能，并利用正确的资源呢？

社区就派上用场了。

世界上有各种学习者的社区，相互帮助提高技能。

社区是一个很难定义的词。Twitter Tech话题是一个社区吗？ freeCodeCamp 论坛呢？还是许多专门针对特定代码技能的 Discord 组和 reddit 话题？

我认为这些都是社区。如果经常有人活跃，互相帮助，我就认为这是一个社区。

面对面的活动呢？奥克兰的 Ruby 开发人员月度聚会？纽约市创业社区聚会？德克萨斯州中部 Linux 用户组？

这些社区可以是在线的、面对面的，或者两者兼而有之。

我们将在 "建立你的网络 "一章中更多地谈及社区。但最大的收获是：你在这些社区中遇到的新朋友可以帮助你缩小选择范围，知道要学什么，要从哪些资源中学习。

### 我应该先学习什么编程语言?

简短的回答是：这并不重要。学好一门编程语言后，学习第二语言就容易多了。

有不同类型的编程语言，但今天大多数开发是使用 "高级脚本语言"，如JavaScript和Python。这些语言放弃了C语言等 "低级编程语言 "的效率，得到的回报是：更容易使用。

今天的计算机比 1970 年代和 80 年代快数十亿倍。那时人们用 C 等语言编写大部分程序。现在计算机速度足以弥补脚本语言的相对低效。

值得注意的是，JavaScript 和 Python 本身都是用 C 语言编写的，而且它们每年都在变得更快——这要归功于它们庞大的开源代码贡献者社区。

Python 是用于科学计算（数据科学和机器学习）的强大语言。

还有 JavaScript……好吧，JavaScript 无所不能。它是终极的瑞士军刀型编程语言。 JavaScript 是将万维网连接在一起的胶带。

> "任何可以用 JavaScript 编写的应用程序，最终都会用 JavaScript 编写。" – 阿特伍德定律 (Jeff Atwood, Stack Overflow 和 Discourse 发起人)

你的整个职业生涯都可以使用JavaScript，并不需要学习第二门语言。
(话是这么说，但是你之后可能会学习Python，或者其他语言)

所以我建议从 JavaScript 开始。它不仅比 Java 和 C++ 等语言更易于使用，而且更易于学习。对于懂 JavaScript 的人来说，工作机会要多得多。

![Find_Javascript_Jobs_with_great_pay_and_benefits_in_United_States___Indeed_com_--](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/Find_Javascript_Jobs_with_great_pay_and_benefits_in_United_States___Indeed_com_--.png)通过Indeed获得的职位搜索截图。 我输入了"javascript"，地区是美国，搜索结果为68838个工作。

The other skills you'll want to focus on are **HTML** and **CSS**. If a webpage were a body, HTML would be the bones, and CSS would be the skin. (JavaScript would be the muscles, making it possible for the website to move around and be interactive.)

You can learn some HTML and CSS in a single afternoon. Like most of the tools I mention here, they are easy to learn, but difficult to master.

You'll also want to learn how to use **Linux**. Linux powers a vast majority of the world's servers, and you will spend much of your career running commands in the Linux command line.

If you have a Mac, MacOS has a terminal that accepts almost all the same commands as Linux. (MacOS and Linux have a common ancestor in Unix.)

But if you're on a Windows PC, you'll want to install WSL, which stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux. You will then be able to run Linux commands on your PC. And if you're feeling particularly adventurous, you can even dual boot both the Windows and Linux operating systems on the same computer.

If you're going to install Linux on a computer, I recommend starting with Ubuntu. It is the most widely used (and widely documented) Linux distribution. So it should be the most forgiving.

Make no mistake – Linux is quite a bit harder to use than Windows and MacOS. But what you get in return for your efforts is an extremely fast, secure, and highly customizable operating system.

Also, you will never have to pay for an operating system license again. Unless you want to. Red Hat is a billion dollar company even though its software is open source, because companies pay for their help servicing and supporting Linux servers.

You'll also want to learn **Git**. This Version Control System is how teams of developers coordinate their changes to a codebase.

You may have heard of GitHub. It's a website that makes it easier for developers to collaborate on open source projects. And it further extends some of the features of Git. You'll learn more about GitHub in the How to Build Your Reputation chapter later.

You'll want to learn **SQL** and how relational databases work. These are the workhorses of the information economy.

You'll also hear a lot about NoSQL databases (Non-relational databases such as graph databases, document databases, and key-value stores.) You can learn more about these later. But focus on SQL first.

Finally, you'll want to learn how **web servers** work. You'll want to start with Node.js and Express.js.

When you hear the term "full stack development" it refers to tying together the front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with the back end (Linux, SQL databases, and Node + Express).

There are lots of other tools you'll want to learn, like React, NGINX, Docker, and testing libraries. You can pick these up as you go.

But the key skills you should spend 90% of your pre-job learning time on are:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Linux
5. Git
6. SQL
7. Node.js
8. Express.js

If you learn these tools, you can build most major web and mobile apps. And you will be qualified for most entry-level developer jobs. (Of course, many job descriptions will include other tools, but we'll discuss these later in the book.)

So you may be thinking: great. How do I learn these?

### Where do I learn how to code?

Funny you should ask. There's a full curriculum designed by experienced software engineers and teachers. It's designed with busy adults in mind. And it's completely free and self-paced.

That's right. I'm talking about [freeCodeCamp's core curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). It will help you learn:

- Front End Development
- Back End Development
- Engineering Mathematics
- and Scientific Computing (with Python for Data Science and Machine Learning)

To date, thousands of people have gone through this core curriculum and gotten a developer job. They didn't need to quit their day job, take out loans, or really risk anything other than some of their nights and weekends.

In practice, freeCodeCamp has become the default path for most people who are learning to code on their own.

If nothing else, the freeCodeCamp core curriculum can be your "home base" for learning, and you can branch out from there. You can learn the core skills that most jobs require, and also dabble in technologies you're interested in.

There are decades worth of books and courses to learn from. Some are available at your public library, or through monthly subscription services. (And you may be able to access some of these subscription services for free through your library as well.)

Also, freeCodeCamp now has nearly 1,000 free full-length courses on everything from AWS certification prep to mobile app development to Kali Linux.

There has never been an easier time to teach yourself programming.

### Building Your Skills is a Life-Long Endeavor

We've talked about why self-teaching is probably the best way to go, and how to go about it.

We've talked about the alternatives to self-teaching, such as getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, or getting a Master's degree.

And we've talked about which specific tools you should focus on learning first.

Now, let's shift gears and talk about how to build the second leg of your stool: your network.

## Chapter 2: How to Build Your Network

> "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." – African Proverb

"Networking." You may wince at the sound of that word.

Networking may bring to mind awkward job fairs in stuffy suits, desperately pushing your résumé into the hands of anyone who will accept it.

Networking may bring to mind alcohol-drenched watch parties – where you pretend to be interested in a sport you don't even follow.

Networking may bring to mind wishing "happy birthday" to people you barely know on LinkedIn, or liking their status updates hoping they'll notice you.

But networking does not have to be that way.

In this chapter, I'll tell you everything I've learned about meeting people. I'll show you how to earn their trust and be top of their mind when they're looking for help.

Because at the end of the day, that's what it's all about. Helping people solve their problems. Being of use to people.

I'll show you how to build a robust personal network that will support you for decades to come.

### Story Time: How did a Teacher in his 30s Build a Network in Tech?

*Last time on Story Time: Quincy learned some coding by reading books, watching free online courses, and hanging out with developers at the local Hackerspace. He had just finished building his first project and given his first tech talk...*

OK – so I now had some rudimentary coding skills. I could now code my way out of the proverbial paper bag.

What was next? After all, I was a total tech outsider.

Well, even though I was new to tech, I wasn't new to working. I'd put food on the table for nearly a decade by working at schools and teaching English.

As a teacher, I got paid to sling knowledge. And as a developer, I'd get paid to sling code.

I already knew one very important truth about the nature of work: it's who you know.

I knew the power of networks. I knew that the path to opportunity goes right through the gatekeepers.

All that stood between me and a lucrative developer job was a hiring manager who could say: "Yes. This Quincy guy seems like someone worthy of joining our team."

Of course, being a tech outsider, I didn't know the culture.

Academic culture is much more formal.

You wear a suit.

You use fancy academic terminology to demonstrate you're part of the "in group."

You find ways to work into every conversation that you went to X university, or that you TA'd under Dr. Y, or that you got published in The Journal of Z.

Career progressions are different. Conferences are different. Power structures are different.

And I didn't immediately appreciate this fact.

The first few tech events I went to, I wore a suit.

I kept neatly-folded copies of my résumé in my pocket at all times.

I even carried business cards. I had ordered sheets of anodized aluminum, and used a laser cutter to etch in my name, email address, and even a quote from legendary educator John Dewey:

> "Anyone who has begun to think places some portion of the world in jeopardy." – John Dewey

It's still my favorite quote to this day.

But talk about heavy-handed.

"Hi, I'm Quincy. Here's my red aluminum business card. Sorry in advance – it might set off the metal detector on your flight home."

I was trying too hard. And it was probably painfully apparent to everyone I talked to.

I went on Meetup.com and RSVP'd for every developer event I could find. Santa Barbara is a small town, but it's near Los Angeles. So I made the drive for events there, too.

I quickly wised up, and traded my suit for jeans and a hoody. And I noticed that no one else gave out business cards. So I stopped carrying them.

I took cues from the devs I met at the hackerspace: Be passionate, but understated. Keep some of your enthusiasm in reserve.

And I read lots of books to better understand developer culture.

[The Coders at Work](https://www.amazon.com/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/B092R8RQM3?crid=13BTAQ7TH9YSN&linkCode=ll1&tag=out0b4b-20&linkId=32d14a148c54f36f5ef701578a2abd8e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) is a good book from the 1980s.

[Hackers: Heroes of the Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396?&linkCode=ll1&tag=out0b4b-20&linkId=0c216f2cd4cc2d2090b8c9b50b0befee&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) is a good book from the 1990s.

For a more contemporary cultural resource, check out the TV series [Mr. Robot](https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Robot-Complete-Rami-Malek/dp/B0833WXXL6?crid=188UUOE6ZT0W3&keywords=mr+robot&qid=1673746625&sprefix=mr+robot%2Caps%2C111&sr=8-6&linkCode=ll1&tag=out0b4b-20&linkId=a896ab7630fadc332c2696d3a4b8e85d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). Its characters are a bit extreme, but they do a good job of capturing the mindset and mannerisms of many developers.

Soon, I was talking less like a teacher and more like a developer. I didn't stick out quite as awkwardly.

Several times a week I attended local tech-related events. My favorite event wasn't even a developer event. It was the Santa Barbara Startup Night. Once every few weeks, they'd have an event where developers would pitch their prototypes. Some of the devs demoing their code were even able to secure funding from angels – rich people who invest in early-stage companies.

The guy who ran the event was named Mike. He must have known every developer and entrepreneur in Santa Barbara.

When I finally got the nerve to introduce myself to Mike, I was star-struck. He was an ultra-marathoner with a resting heartbeat in the low 40s. Perfectly cropped hair and beard. To me he was the coolest guy on the planet. Always polished. Always respectful.

Mike was "non-technical." He worked as a product manager. And though he knew a lot about technology and user experience design, he didn't know how to code.

Sometimes devs would write non-technical people off. "He's just a business guy," they'd say. Or: "She's a suit." But I never heard anyone say that about Mike. He had the respect of everyone.

I made a point to watch the way Mike interacted with developers. After all, I wasn't that far removed from "non-technical" myself. I'd only been coding for a few months.

Often my old habits would creep in. During conversations I'd have the temptation to show off what I'd learned or what I'd built.

Many developers are modest about their skills or accomplishments. They might say: "I dabble in Python." And little 'ol insecure me would open his big mouth and say something like, "Oh yeah. I've coded so many algorithms in Python. I write Python in my sleep."

And then I'd go home and google that developer's name, and realize they were a core contributor to a major Python library. And I'd kick myself.

I quickly learned not to boast of my accomplishments or my skills. There's a good chance a person you're talking to can code circles around you. But most of them would never volunteer this fact.

There's nothing worse than confidently pulling out your laptop, showing off your code, and then having someone ask you a bunch of questions that you're wholly unprepared to answer.

My first few months of attending events was a humbling experience. But these events energized me to keep pushing forward with my skills.

Soon people around southern California would start to recognize me. They'd say: "I keep running to you at these events. What's your name again?"

One night a dev said, "Let's follow each other on Twitter." I had grudgingly set up a Twitter account a few days earlier, thinking it was a gimmicky website. How much could you really convey with just 140 characters? I had barely tweeted anything. But I did have a Twitter account ready, and she did follow me.

That inspired me to spend more time refining my online presence. I made my LinkedIn less formal and more friendly. I looked at how other devs in the community presented themselves online.

Within a few months, I knew people from so many fields:

- experienced developers
- non-technical or semi-technical people who worked at tech companies
- hiring managers and recruiters
- and most importantly, my peers who were also mid-career and trying to break into tech

Why were peers the most important? Surely they would be the least able to help me get a job, right?

Well, let me tell you a secret: let's say a hiring manager brings on a new dev, trains them, and they turn out to be really good at their job. That hiring manager is going to ask: where can I find more people like you?

Your peers are one of the most important pieces of your network. So many of my freelance opportunities and job interview opportunities came from people who started learning to code around the same time as I did.

We came up together. We were brothers and sisters in arms. Those bonds are the tightest.

Anyway, all this networking over the months would ultimately come to fruition one night when I walked into the bar of a fancy downtown hotel for a developer event.

But more on that in the next chapter. Now let's talk more about the art and science of building your network.

### Is it Really Who You Know?

You may have heard the expression that success is "less about what you know, and more about who you know."

In practice, it's about both.

Yes – your connections may help you land your dream job. But if you're out of your depth, and lack the skills to succeed, you will not fare well in that role.

But let's assume that you are proactively building your skills. You've followed my advice from Chapter 1. When is the right time to start building your network?

The best time to start building your network is **yesterday**.

But you don't need a time machine to do this. Because you already have a network. It's probably much smaller than you'd like it to be, but you **do** know people.

They may be friends from your home town, or the colleagues of your parents. Any person you know from your past – however marginally – may be of help.

因此，第一步是对你认识的人进行全面盘点。请不要担心，我并不是要你现在就去接触任何人，也不是在考验你的人际关系。

三思而后行，先制定一个行动计划。

首先，让我们一起来列出所有你认识的人。

### 如何打造个人关系网看板

从创建一个熟人清单开始。

你可以使用电子表格，也可以像销售人员那样使用客户关系管理工具（CRM）来做这件事。但就我们这里要做的事情而言，它们可能有点大材小用了。

我推荐使用像 Trello 这样的看板工具，它是免费的。

你将创建五大列：“待评估”、“待联系”、“待回复”、“最近联系”、“暂不联系”。

然后创建标签，这样你就可以根据你对他们的了解程度对他们进行分类了。这里有一些可供你参考的标签想法："儿时好友"、"家庭的朋友"、"前同事"、"同学"、"参加技术活动认识的朋友"。

现在你可以开始创建卡片了。每张卡片可以只有他们的名字，如果你有时间的话，可以在卡片上添加一张照片。

这是我创建的 Trello 看板，你可以从中得知个人关系网看板可能是什么样子的。我使用了我最喜欢的童年电影（1989 年的经典电影《忍者神龟》）中的人物。

<figure><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/Personal_Network_Board___Trello_--.png"><figcaption>我的个人关系网看板：副业中一起打击犯罪的朋友们</figcaption></figure>

你可以开始从你的社交媒体帐号，甚至你老旧的毕业纪念册（如果你有的话）添加联系人。

他们中的许多人不会再有任何帮助。但为了全面起见，我建议你依然添加他们。你永远不知道什么时候你会想起："噢……某某在 XYZ 公司得到了一份工作，我应该与他们联系。"

这个过程可能要花一两天的时间。但要知道，这是一项投资。这个看板能够在你的职业生涯中为你所用。

你可能会认为“我不需要这样做，我已经有一个领英账户了”。这或许能行得通，但是领英又大又杂。但你想在这里让信号最大化，让噪音最小化。这也是我鼓励你创建这个专门的个人关系网看板的原因。

在你把人添加到你的看板的同时，还可以给他们贴上标签。花点时间来研究看板中的每一个人。他们这些天都在忙什么？他们有工作吗？还是在开公司？

当你发现了和他们有关的事情，可以在每张卡片上添加笔记。他们最近是否参加了跑步 5 公里的募捐活动？他们的祖母最近是否庆祝了九十大寿？这些信息看起来可能无关紧要。但如果某个人在社交媒体上分享这些事情，那就说明这些事情对他们来说很重要。

努力对人们产生兴趣。发现他们的日常生活，发现他们的抱负。通过了解他们的动机和目标，你将更深入地洞察到你如何才能帮到他们。

正如我之前所说，缔结盟友的最佳方式是帮助他人。我们将在稍后详细讨论这个问题。

对于你添加到个人关系网看板中的每个人，逐一思考他们是否值得联系，然后把他们放入“待联系”或“暂不联系”中。

你可能想知道：为什么这一列叫 “暂不联系”？因为你永远不知道认识的某个人在何时会帮上忙。永远不要把任何友谊或熟人关系视为理所当然。

在你填满看板，给每个人贴上标签，并将他们分门别类之后，就可以开始联系了。

### 如何为关系网延伸做准备

在联系并试图给人留下印象时，请牢记：简单为上，不要啰嗦。

大家都很忙，他们并不能记住太多和你有关的事情。如果你想完全讲清楚自己是谁，最好方法是写一份个人简历。

#### 如何在社交媒体写个人简历

你希望自己的信息在你所有的社交媒体账户中都是一致的。

以下是我的自我介绍：

“我叫 Quincy，是 freeCodeCamp 的一名老师，住在德克萨斯州的达拉斯。我可以帮助你学习编程。”

去写你自己的简历吧。看看你能否把它压缩到 100 个字甚至更少。尽量避免使用花哨的词语或专业术语。

把你的身份提炼成几个字可能很难，但这是一个很重要的过程。

记住：人们很忙，他们并不需要知道你的生活往事。随着你对他们的了解的深入，你可以慢慢地说出更多和你有关的细节。随着时间的推移，他们也会在问你问题的同时更好地了解你。

好了，记得准备好一张带有你的笑脸的照片。

#### 如何制作社交媒体头像

如果你有钱，直接去找一个当地的摄影师，付钱让他们给你拍一些专业的头像。

或许你有一个从事摄影的朋友，他可以免费为你拍照。

我自己使用预装在 MacOS 上的 Photobooth 拍了头像。我的朋友在 Photoshop 中花了大约 10 分钟修正了一些背景和阴影。他可能使我的牙齿看起来要略微白了一点。下面是我的头像：

<figure><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/Michael_Headshot_B_W_Full_heic.png"><figcaption>我的头像：我在任何地方都使用这张照片</figcaption></figure>

一定要用你的眼睛微笑，这样你才不会看起来像个机器人。或者更好一点，想一些非常有趣的事情，我就是这样做的。然后，你的笑容就会显得很真诚。

从不同的角度拍很多照片，然后使用最好看的那一张。

我建议你使用一张看起来和你的日常生活贴近的始终如一头像。不要使用试图将你的吸引力最大化的经过大量修改的照片。你希望人们能够在活动中通过你的照片认出你。而且，你不想让美颜吓到别人，你想让他们感到安心。

说到让人安心：不要戴墨镜，也不要努力地看起来很酷。你要看起来友好、平易近人。在这方面，有的一个很好的带有讽刺意味的测试：看看你的照片。如果你迷路了，你在街上看到这个人，你会有勇气向他们问路吗？

选好了头像之后，就在所有的地方使用同一张照片。把它放在你所有的社交媒体账户上。

在你的个人网站上使用它，甚至你还可以[将个人照片添加到你的电子邮件帐户](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gmail-profile-picture/)。

我建议常年来使用同一张照片。每次你改变它，都会冒着有些人不会立即认出你的风险。即使是灯光、角度或背景的细微变化，也会使人们失去熟悉感。

一定要保留一张高清版本的照片。这样，当你在别人的会议上的演讲，或他们的播客中的客串的时候，他们就可以用这张照片来宣传了。(别担心，假以时日，你能做到的）。

### 如何与过去的人联系

现在简历和照片都已就绪，你已经做好与人交谈的准备了。

15 年前，我会说你应该给人们打电话，而不是给他们发消息。但随着智能手机的出现，相关文化已经发生了很大的变化。大多数人都不会很好地回应电话了。

同样，我也不建议在谈话接近尾声的时候才邀请别人去喝咖啡或吃午餐。人们很忙，可能会觉得这个请求有些尴尬。

你需要直奔主题，越快越好。

那么，你需要奔入的主题是什么呢？

本质上如下：

1. 我知道你
2. 我喜欢你
3. 我敬佩你的做的事情

就是这样。

人们喜欢被了解，喜欢被人喜欢，喜欢自己做的事情和生活受到关注。

我们中的大多数人都会在生日当天得到认可。在过去，人们可能会通过短信、社交媒体，甚至打电话的方式祝我们生日快乐。

但一年中的其它 364 天呢？人们也喜欢在这些日子里得到认可。

哈哈，这里有一个认可别人的简单方法。

第 1 步：研究这个人。在谷歌上搜索他们，阅读他们最近发布在社交媒体上的内容，阅读他们的领英账户。如果他们发布了家庭照片，更要多花点时间看一下。

第 2 步：想一想你可以说点什么，从而让他们的一天变得更加美好。

第 3 步：选择一个他们最近比较活跃的社交媒体平台，直接给他们发一条信息。

我将分享一个模板，但永远不要逐字逐句地使用任何模板，因为如果收件人将你的信息,用谷歌进行搜索，他们会发现这是一个模板，而你所有的善意将被误解。

如果我突然给一个几个月或几年没有联系过的人发信息，我会说这样的话:

"嘿，[姓名]，我希望你的[新的一年/春天/一周]有一个有趣的开始。祝贺你[新工作/晋升/新生儿/完成项目]。看到你在外面做事情，很受鼓舞。"

像这样简短而有针对性的东西。问候+祝贺+赞美。这就是基本公式。

不要只是说出来。

真的想让这个人感到被认可。真的想照亮他们的一天。真的想鼓励他们继续向他们的目标迈进。

人类非常善于察觉不诚恳。不要试图过度推销。不要给他们任何理由去想 "这个人想从我这里得到什么"。

这就是为什么这方面最重要的事情是：要简短。要尊重人们的时间。没有人想要一封长信，他们会觉得有义务对其进行长时间的回应。

因为，跟我说一遍 **人很忙**。

### 如何建立更深入的联系

因为人们是如此忙碌，他们往往会因为这些陌生人能为他们做什么而更多地看到陌生人:

- 这个人开着巴士送我去上班。
- 这个人按照我喜欢的方式给我做饮料。
- 这个人在人力资源部门回答我关于休假的问题。
- 这个人为我准备了一份 acid 爵士乐的播放列表，让我在写代码时听。
- 这个人每周都会给我发送有用的电子邮件，提供免费的编程资源。

在某种程度上，你就是你为人们所做的。

我知道，我知道。这听起来可能过于简化。甚至愤世嫉俗。而对于你生活中的亲密朋友和家人来说，这 100%不是真的。

但是对于那些几乎不认识你的人--他们只是在日常工作中遇到你--这可能是他们对你的看法。

你必须给人们一个关心你的理由。 你必须激励他们更多地了解你。

在你能成为某人的亲密朋友之前，他们真正关心的人，并且在你不在的时候想到的人，你需要从一个对他们有帮助的人开始。

而这正是我们在这里要做的。我们要通过提供帮助来建立更深的关系。

这将是一个漫长的过程。而且你应该在找工作之前提前开始。你最不希望看到的是，有人认为 "哦，你只是因为需要我的东西而伸出援手"。

恰恰相反，你伸出援手是因为你有东西可以提供给他们。

毕竟，你拥有一个人可以获得的最强大的技能之一。使机器服从你的意志的能力。你是一个程序员。

![c_BasicProgramming_Picture_front](https://atariage.com/2600/carts/c_BasicProgramming_Picture_front.jpg)这就是擅长编码的感觉。

或者，至少，你正在成为一个人的道路上。

所以你已经有了一个很好的理由去接触人们。

你可能听说过 **冷电话** 这个词。这就是你在对某人几乎一无所知的情况下给他打电话，并试图向他们推销东西。这并不容易，绝大部分的冷电话都以对方挂断而告终。

但是，你对对方了解的信息越多，电话就越温暖，你就越有可能成功。

现在，你在这里不是在卖东西。正如我前面提到的，你也不是在给他们打电话。你是在给他们发送一条直接信息。

也许这是通过 Twitter、LinkedIn、Discord、Reddit。 任何地方。但你是用一段文字向他们伸出援手。

正如我所说，最有力的开场白,最有可能得到回应的方法，是随意地提供帮助。

如果我在做这件事，这里有一个我将使用的简单模板。记住不要逐字逐句地使用这个模板。用你自己的声音重写，你会怎么对朋友说。\:

> "嘿[姓名]，祝贺你[新工作/晋升/新生儿]。我一直在学习一些编程，并正在建立我的作品集。我立刻想到了你，你是一个能完成很多事情的人。有没有什么工具或应用程序可以让你的生活更轻松？我也许可以为你编码，作为我的练习。"

这是一个强有力的方法，因为它是个性化的，不会让人觉得是自动的。如今，人们收到如此多的自动信息，以至于他们很快就会无视任何甚至类似于自动信息的东西。

这就是为什么我手动发送我所有的信息，而不依赖自动化。慢慢地逐一编写信息比试图用脚本或邮件合并来节省时间更好。

最快的被屏蔽的方法是给别人发消息说 `嗨，你好吗？` 其中明显少了一个名字,证明这个消息是一个模板。

有时我收到的信息用我的姓而不是我的名。`嘿，拉森。` 什么，我现在是在军事学校吗？

而且，LinkedIn 上的很多人已经开始在他们名字的开头加上一个表情符号。这使得检测自动信息变得很容易，因为没有人会在他们的直接信息中包括这个表情符号。

当一条信息的开头是 "嗨🍜莎拉，你在找新工作吗？" 那么你就知道这是一条批量信息。

还要注意的是，我上面的模板并没有说 "我们是同学 "或类似的话。除非你几天前刚认识某人，否则你不应该说明你们俩是怎么认识的。

为什么？因为提醒人们你们是如何认识的行为本身会促使一些人退一步想："哎呀，我几乎不认识这个人。"

### 如何让对话持续下去

同样，你的目标是得到他们的回应，这样你就可以开始一个来回的对话。

这些信息传递平台有一种休闲的感觉。保持随意。

不要发送单一的、多段落的信息。保持你的信息短而快。你不想让他们觉得回复你是件苦差事。

一旦你让他们回复你，就开始在你的个人网络板上做笔记，这样你以后就能记住这些事实。

也许他们确实有一些应用程序的想法或工具的想法。很好。向他们询问有关问题。看看你是否可以为他们建立它。

从画出用户界面的简单模型开始。如果你想看起来更复杂，就用绘图纸。给它拍张照片，然后发给他们。"像这样的东西？"

这将确立你对帮助他们是认真的。而且我愿意打赌，对大多数人来说，这将是一种新的体验。

"你在帮助我？你在为我创建这个应用程序？" 这将是一种奉承，他们将有可能记住它。即使这个应用程序本身没有任何进展。

从那里开始，你可以随着谈话的流程走。也许它消失了。不用担心。随它去吧。你可以在几周后找到一个理由来重新拾起对话。

这些社交媒体直接信息的好处是整个信息记录都在那里。下次你给他们发信息时，他们可以直接滚动并看到 "哦，这是那个提议为我建立应用程序的人"。没有更多的 "你是谁来着？"的疑问，而你可能在面对面的谈话中得到。

再次重申，保持一切休闲和乐观。 如果感觉谈话进行得很慢，那没问题。 因为您将进行许多其他对话。保持热度，你将成为一只忙碌的蜜蜂，建立你的人际联系。

### 如何认识新朋友并扩大你的人际网络

我们已经谈到了如何与你已经认识的人联系。这些联系仍然存在，即使它们多年来已经有点萎缩了。

但你如何建立全新的联系？

这不是一件容易的事。但我有一些建议，可以使这个过程不那么令人生畏。

首先，第一次与人见面，比在网上见面要有效的多。

当你见到某人的时候，你的记忆有更多的信息可以获取:

- 这个人的长相，他们的姿势，以及他们如何在空间中移动
- 他们的声音和他们说话的方式
- 灯光、声音、香气、温度和场地的总体感觉
- 还有许多其他的小细节，这些都会在你的记忆中留下烙印

与一个人当面交谈 10 分钟，比来回几十条信息，跨越几周的通信建立更深的联系。

这就是为什么我强烈建议：走出去，在当地的活动中认识人们。

### 如何在城市周边的当地活动中结识朋友

哪些活动？如果你住在一个人口稠密的城市，你可能有大量的选择供你支配。你可能每周都能去参加几个晚上的科技活动，而且通勤时间最少。

如果你住在一个小镇上，你可能不得不坚持在当地的聚会上认识人。书展、冰激凌社交活动、体育赛事。

如果你去教堂、清真寺或寺庙，也要认识那里的人。

是的，我知道这可能听起来很荒谬。"在足球比赛中站在我旁边看台的那个人？他们会以某种方式帮助我找到一份开发商的工作？"

也许吧。也许不是。但不要把人撇开。

那个人可能经营一个小企业。

他们可能和一个在财富 500 强公司担任工程副总裁的朋友一起上学。

也许他们也是一名软件工程师。毕竟，我们有数以百万计的软件工程师在那里。而且我们并不都住在硅谷。 😉

当你遇到一个新的人时，你不想立即掏出你的手机，说 `我可以把你加入我的LinkedIn 的联系人吗？`

相反，你要表现得冷静。介绍一下自己。

**记住他们的名字。**名字是建立关系不可或缺的。如果你不善于记名字，就练习记住它们。你可以在看电视节目或电影时，试着记住每个角色的名字,不管他们是不是大明星，来练习。

如果你忘记某人的名字，不要猜测。只要说 `你叫什么名字来着`，第二次一定要记住它。

与他们握手或握拳。与他们谈论任何感觉自然的话题。如果谈话结束了，不用担心。随它去吧。

你随着时间的推移建立关系。这不是指与某人相处的总时间,而是指你在较长的时间跨度内与该人见面的次数。

有一个很好的机会，你会在未来再次见到这个人。也许几周后，在同一个确切的地点。而就是你采取行动的时候:

`你好[姓名]，[你们上次谈的事情]进展如何？`

从中断处继续对话。 如果他们看起来像是对您的个人网络板 (Personal Network Board)有帮助的人，请问他们 `嘿，你接下来 [星期几] 在做什么？你想和我一起去 [其他即将举行的本地活动] 吗？”`

始终牢记你即将到来的一周的活动，所以你可以邀请人们加入你。

这是一个让人们在一个安全的公共空间与你一起玩耍的好方法。而且你还提供了一些有价值的东西,让他们意识到即将到来的活动。

如果他们看起来感兴趣，你可以说 "太棒了。我有什么最好的方式给你留言，并把活动的细节告诉你？"

你现在有了他们的电子邮件或社交媒体或电话号码，你们的关系可以从那里展开。

这可能听起来像是一种慢热的方法。为什么如此谨慎？

同样，人们很忙。聪明人会保护他们的时间和他们的个人信息。

外面有太多的吸血鬼想利用人们,试图向他们推销东西，诈骗他们，让他们加入他们的多层次营销计划，或以其他方式向他们传教。

让其他人克服这种不信任的最好方法是：在以前的接触中已经作为一个通情达理的人，出现在他们的视野上。

### 如何利用你的人际网络

我们将在第 4 章详细讨论如何利用您的网络。现在，将您的网络纯粹视为时间和精力的投资。

我喜欢把我的人际关系想象成一个果园。 我正在建立关系。 照顾他们，确保他们健康。

谁知道这些关系何时会长成大树并结出果实。 目标是继续植树，在未来的某个时候，这些树将帮助维持你的生命。

不断散发正能量。 不断提供帮助人们使用你的技能，甚至是你自己的人际关系。（在你认识的两个人之间进行礼貌的介绍很少是一个坏举动。）

做一个善良、体贴、乐于助人的人。

永远不要对求职过程的缓慢感到不耐烦。

永远不要让自己感到被轻视或冷落。

永远不要让自己嫉妒别人的成功。

有因就有果。有一天你会收获你所播种的东西。如果你播种的是正能量，你就为自己的丰收做了准备。

## 第三章：如何建立你的声誉

> "获得良好声誉的方法是努力成为你希望出现的样子"。  苏格拉底

现在你已经开始建立你的技能和你的人际网络，你已经准备好开始建立你的声誉。

你可能从零开始，一个完全的技术新人。或者你可能已经有了一些信誉，你可以从你的其他工作中带来。

在本章中，我将分享如何在同行中建立良好声誉的实用技巧。这将是获得自由职业者客户、第一份工作以及在事业上取得进展的关键。

但首先，我是如何建立我的声誉的。

### 故事时间：一位 30 多岁的教师是如何建立起开发者的声誉的？

*上一次是在故事时间。昆西开始建立他的网络，包括开发人员、企业家和科技界的招聘经理。他经常参加城市周围的黑客空间和科技活动。但他还没有爬上竞技场，测试自己的实力……*。

当我终于鼓起勇气去参加我的第一次黑客马拉松时，我的编码之旅已经有几个月了。

有一天，我遇到了一个特别讨厌的错误，我不知道如何解决它。所以我做了很多人在这种情况下会做的事情。我通过浏览网页来拖延时间。这时我看到了它。创业周末（Startup Weekend EDU）。

创业周末是一个长达 54 小时的比赛，包括建立一个应用程序，然后将其提交给评审团。这些活动也奖励你的编码、设计和创业知识。

这个特别的活动--在硅谷的中心地带举行，有一个由教育家和教育企业家组成的评审团。由于我有成人教育的背景，这似乎是我第一次参加黑客马拉松的理想选择。

我把这个活动告诉了史蒂夫。然后我说出了那句神奇的话。"由我来开车"。这很好，因为史蒂夫没有驾驶执照。

有了史蒂夫的加入，我们与来自圣巴巴拉黑客空间的几个开发人员组成了我们的团队。

我花了几周时间准备这次活动，研究评委和他们工作的公司。我研究了赞助商。当然，我还像少林寺的和尚一样练习编码。

终于，经过一个月的准备，迎来了大周末。 我们挤进我的 2005 年丰田卡罗拉，车上的透明涂层已经剥落，放上一些充满活力的音乐，开始了我们 5 小时的车程。

在路上，我们讨论了我们应该建造什么。当然，它将是以教育为重点的。最好是满足高中生的需求，因为这些是评审人员的公司所关注的年级。

但这个应用程序应该做什么？它将如何使人们的生活更轻松？

我回想了一下我自己在高中的时候。我没有什么可说的，因为我只上了一年就退学了。(我确实设法学习并通过了普通教育证书，我们称之为 "足够好的学位"，同时在 Taco Bell 工作，最后才上了大学）。

但我确实记得高中时的一个痛点，在这么多年后仍然响起。英语论文。

现在我喜欢写作。但我不喜欢用 MLA 格式写作，因为它有严格的引证规则。我曾经害怕准备工作引证页。我的老师总是会因为我的引文格式不正确而扣我的分。

在听了车上其他乘客的很多好主意后，我开始说了。 我说：“我有个主意。我们应该编写一个应用程序，为您创建引文。”

而有人笑着说： "看不见了。"

史蒂夫说，“嘿，这是个好名字。我们可以用 `C` 称它为 `Out of Cite`。

我们都笑了起来，觉得自己很聪明。然后我们开始讨论实施细节。

当我们到达会场时，那里有大约 100 名其他开发人员。那是一个开放式的办公空间，低矮的隔间两边是白板。

我听到了关于其中一个开发者的窃窃私语。"嘿，是那个去年赢得比赛的家伙。" 我听到人们说。他们向一个被粉丝包围的、看起来很自负的开发者打手势。"也许他会让我加入他的团队。"

活动开始时，大家纷纷发表意见。任何人都可以走到房间前面，拿起麦克风，为他们想要建立的应用程序做 60 秒的演讲。

我太紧张了，感觉就像一个外星人要从我的胸膛里冲出来。 所以很自然地，我排在第一位。 撕掉创可贴，对吧？

我满头大汗，疯狂地打着手势，飞快地完成我的演讲。我说了这样一段话。"引文很烂。我的意思是，它们并不糟糕。它们是必要的。你需要把它们添加到你的论文中。但准备引文的工作很糟糕。让我们建立一个应用程序，为你填写你的工作引文页。谁支持我？"

房间里很安静。然后人们意识到我已经讲完了，他们给了我一个强制性的掌声。主持人从我手中拿过麦克风，把它交给下一个人，而我则蹦蹦跳跳地回到了我的座位。

投球结束后，就到了组队的时间。我们的圣巴巴拉小分队互相看了看，说 "我想我们是一个团队"。

我们弄清了 WIFI 密码，抢到了最合适的工作场所：一个角落里的办公室，有一扇可以真正关闭的门。

我开始在白板上写下 UI 模型。我说："我们想要的东西总是一击即中。就在你的浏览器的菜单栏里。"

"像一个浏览器插件，"史蒂夫说。

"是的。让我们建立一个浏览器扩展。"

我向他们展示了论文可能需要的三种格式的例子。MLA，APA，和 Chicago。

"我们能不能同时生成这三种格式，让他们可以直接复制粘贴？我问道。

"我们可以做得更好，"史蒂夫说。"我们可以为他们每个人设置一个按钮，把引文直接放到他们的剪贴板中。"

我们工作得很快，在星期五晚上结束时创造了一个简单的 MVP（最小可行产品）。它所做的只是抓取当前网站的元数据，并将其结构化为一个引文。但它成功了。

由于这是我第一次参加黑客马拉松，我不想承受住在旅馆里的压力。所以我花钱买了一个酒店房间。我们有两张双人床，所以每天晚上我们都会轮流睡在地板上。

星期六早上，我们的野心越来越大。我走到白板前，对团队说。"引用网站是伟大的，所有的。但学生们引用的很多东西都是在书本或学术论文中。我们也需要能够为这些东西生成引文。"

我们找到了一个 API，我们可以用它来获取基于 ISBN（用于书籍的序列号）的引文信息。我们还写了一个脚本，可以根据 DOI（用于学术论文的序列号）搜索学术论文，然后从结果页中刮取数据。

到了星期六晚上，我们的浏览器扩展的代码终于完成了。于是我坐下来，开始准备演示幻灯片。我把很多最后的编码工作留给了我的队友，而我则反复排练了几个小时的演讲。

尽管轮到我在床上睡觉，但由于紧张，我几乎无法闭目养神。我在这里，就在科技生态系统的中心。硅谷。

作为一名教师，我经常在我的同行面前发表演讲，有时是几十个人。但这是不同的。

几个小时后，我将向一屋子雄心勃勃的开发者发表演讲。还有评委。拥有博士学位的人，其中一些人已经创办了自己的科技公司。他们将对我们的工作进行评估。我很害怕自己会以某种方式搞砸。

由于无法入睡，我打开了我的电子邮件。创业周末的工作人员发出了一封电子邮件，其中包括一本书的 PDF。这是一本非官方的科技创业经典 [顿悟的 4 个步骤](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=ll1&tag=out0b4b-20&linkId=662e9d222ccd9aa050d3ad29438e74e3&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) 和 [精益创业](https://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Eric-Ries-audiobook/dp/B005MM7HY8?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=ll1&tag=out0b4b-20&linkId=13b3c19bdbda93658336cf7c69e27100&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) 的混搭。

现在，我已经读过这些书，因为它们是 2010 年代初期想要构建软件产品的任何人的必读书籍。 但我还阅读了数十本其他创业书籍。 他们的很多见解都汇集在一起，形成了一堆建议。

凌晨 4 点，我无法入睡。 所以我才开始阅读。 这些书真正触及的一件事是构建人们愿意支付的东西。 客户验证的最终形式。

就在那时我意识到：你知道什么能真正推动我的演讲越过终点线吗？ 产品市场契合度的证明。 证明我们正在构建的应用程序解决了人们遇到的实际问题。 如此之多，以至于他们会打开钱包。

This gave me an idea. I should take our app on the road and sell it to people.

But it was Sunday morning. Where was I going to find potential customers? Well, our hotel just happened to be located near the main campus of Stanford University.

I drove my team to the event venue, waved goodbye and said: "I'll come back when I have cold, hard cash from customers."

My teammates chuckled. I'm not sure if they thought I was serious. They said, "Don't be late for the pitch."

But I was serious. I had a prototype of the app running on my laptop. I punched Stanford into my GPS and embarked on my mission.

Now, I studied at a really inexpensive state university in Oklahoma. So I felt really out of my depth when I rolled up to one of the premier universities in the world.

Stanford costs $50,000 per year to attend. And I pulled into their parking lot driving a car worth 1/10th of that.

The campus was a ghost town this time of the week. But a palatial ghost town, none the less. Bronze statues. Iconic arches everywhere.

I asked myself: where are the most high-achieving, hard-core students this time of day? The ones who don't have time to waste on manually creating their Work Cited pages?

I walked into the main library, right past the security desk and a sign that said "no soliciting."

I strode around the stacks, finding a small handful of people studying. This one kid was studiously taking notes as he read through a thick textbook. Bingo.

I slid into the seat next to him. "Psst. Hey. Do you like citations?"

"What?"

"Citations. You know, like, work cited pages."

"Um..."

"You know, the last page of your paper, where you have to list all the..."

"I know what a work cited page is."

"OK. Well check this out." I pulled my jacket to the side like a drug dealer, and whipped out my $200 netbook. He humored me for a moment while I delivered my awkward sales pitch.

I said: "Here. I've got this browser plugin. I go to any website, click the button, and voilà. It will create a citation for me."

The kid raised his eyebrows. "Can it do MLA?"

I bit back my excitement and said, "MLA, APA, and even Chicago. Watch." I clicked the button and three citations appeared – each with its own copy-to-clipboard button.

The kid nodded, seeming somewhat impressed. So I attempted to close the sale.

"What if I told you that I was about to launch this app with a yearly subscription. But if you sign up now, I'll get unlimited access not for a year, but for a lifetime."

The kid thought for a moment.

I had heard that silence was the salesperson's best friend. So I sat there for an uncomfortably long time in total silence, staring him down.

Finally he said: "Cool I'm in."

"Awesome. That'll be twenty bucks."

The kid recoiled. "What? That's expensive."

This was of course the era of venture capital-subsidized startups, where Uber and Lyft were losing money on every ride in a race for market share. So the kid's reaction was not totally surprising.

But I thought fast. "Well, how much cash do you have on you?"

He fumbled with his wallet, then said, "five bucks."

I looked at the crumpled bill and shrugged. "Sold."

He smiled, and I sent him an email with instructions for how to install it. Then I said, "One more thing. Let's take a picture together."

I put my phone on selfie mode. He started to smile, and I said, "Here. Hold up the five dollar bill."

I spent another hour pitching people in the library, and managed to get another paying customer as well. Then I raced back to the event venue to finalize our prototype with the team.

That afternoon, I gave what I still think is the best presentation of my life. We live-demoed the working app – which worked perfectly.

We ended the presentation with the photos I'd taken, posing with Stanford students who were now our paying customers. When I held up the cash, the audience burst into applause.

Overall, it was one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life. We came in second place, and won some API credit from one of the companies who sponsored the event.

At the after party, I chipmunked some pizza, so I'd have more time to network with everyone I could. I connected on LinkedIn. I followed on Twitter. I snapped selfies together with people and used the heck out of the event's hashtag.

This was a watershed moment in my coding journey. I had proven to the people in that room that I could help design, code, and even sell an app. And more importantly, I'd proven it to myself.

### Riding the Hackathon Circuit

From that moment on, I was hooked on hackathons. That year, I participated in dozens of them. I became a road warrior, railing up and down the coast, attending every competition I could.

It would be much harder from here on out. I didn't have a team anymore. I was on my own.

I'd arrive, meet as many people as I could, then go up and pitch an idea I thought might win over the judges.

Sometimes people joined my team. Sometimes I joined other people's teams.

I didn't merely want to design apps – I wanted to code them, too. And my reach often exceeded my grasp.

There were many hackathons where I would still be trying to fix bugs down to the final minutes before going on stage. Sometimes my apps would crash during live demos.

One hackathon in Las Vegas, I managed to screw up the codebase so badly that we just had to use a slideshow. I sat in the audience with my head in my hands, watching helplessly as my team member demonstrated how our app would hypothetically work – if I could have gotten it to work. We didn't fare well with the judges.

But I kept grinding. Kept arriving in new towns, checking into the hostel, and hitting the venue, and eating as much free pizza as I could.

My teams had come in second or third so many times I could barely keep count. But we'd never managed to outright win a hackathon.

### Breaking Through

That was until an event in San Diego. I'll never forget the feeling of building something that won over the audience and judges to the extent that our victory felt like a foregone conclusion.

After they announced us as the winner, I remember sneaking out the back door to a parking lot and calling my grandparents. I told them that I'd finally done it. I'd helped build an app and craft a pitch that had won a hackathon.

I don't know how much my grandparents understood about software development, or about hackathons. But they said they were proud of me.

With them gone now, I often think back to this conversation. I cherish their encouragement. Their faith in a 30-something teacher who was trying like crazy to become a developer.

I kept going to hackathons after that. I kept forming new teams and learning new tools along the way. You never forget the first time you get an API to work. Or when you finally grok how some Git command works. And you never forget the people hustling alongside you, trying to get the app to hold together through the demo.

The TechCrunch Disrupt hackathon. The DeveloperWeek hackathon. The ProgrammableWeb hackathon. The $1 Million Prize Salesforce Hackathon. So many big hackathons and so much learning. This was the crucible where my developer chops were forged.

Not only did I manage to build my skills and my network along the way – I now had a reputation as someone who could actually win a hackathon.

I could ship.

This made me a known quantity.

And that reputation was crucial to getting my first freelance clients, my first developer job, and most importantly – trusting my own instincts as a dev.

### Why Your Reputation is So Important

The role of reputation in society goes way, way back to human prehistory. In most tribes and settlements, there was some system to keep track of who owed what to whom.

Before there was cash, there was credit.

This may have been a written ledger. Or it may have been an elder who simply kept all these records in their head.

Beyond raw accounting, there was also a less tangible, but equally important vibe that people carried with them.

"John sure knows how to shoe a horse."

Or "Jane is the best story teller in the land."

Or "Jay's courage in battle saved us against the invaders three winters ago."

You'll note that these examples all involve someone being good at something. Not merely being a good, likable person.

It certainly helps to be a chill, down-to-earth human being. But this isn't The Big Lebowski, and we aren't going to survive on our charm alone.

![image__2000-1338_](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/image__2000-1338_.png)The Big Lebowski (left). He had no job, he had no skills, he had no energy. But he had chill, out the wazoo.

It's easy for a developer to say: "Oh yeah. I know JavaScript like the back of my hand. I can build you any kind of JavaScript application you need, running on any device you can think of."

Or to say: "I ship code under budget and ahead of time – all the time."

But how do you know they're not exaggerating their claims?

After all, a devious man once said:

> "If you can only be good at one thing, be good at lying.
>
> Then you're good at everything."

(The true provenance of this quote is unknown. But I like to imagine it was said by a 1920s con man wearing a top hat and a monocle.)

Anyone can lie. And some people do.

Earlier in my career, I had the unpleasant task of firing a teacher who had lied about earning a master's degree. The years went by and nobody caught it.

Every year, he would lie on his annual paperwork, so that he could get a higher pay raise than the other teachers. And every year, he would get away with it.

But one day a small discrepancy tipped me off. I reviewed his file, called up some university record departments, and discovered that he had never bothered finishing his degree.

When I caught him it was a real Scooby Doo moment. "And I would have gotten away with it, if not for you darn kids."

It sucked to know that this person was teaching at the school for years and getting paid more than many of the other teachers – just because he was willing to lie.

The spoils of lying are always there, glistening. Some people are willing to give in to that temptation.

Employers know this. They know you can't trust just any person who claims to know full-stack JavaScript development. You have to be cautious about who gets a company badge, a company email address, and the keys to your production databases.

This is why employers use behavioral interview questions – to try and catch people who are more capable of dishonesty.

Call me naive, but I believe that most people are inherently good. That most people are willing to play by the rules as long as those rules are reasonably fair.

But if even one person out of ten would be a disaster hire, it means that all of us are subjected to higher scrutiny.

The worst-case scenario is not merely someone who lies to make more money. It's someone who sells company secrets, destroys relationships with customers, or breaks laws in the name of inflating their numbers.

History is rife with employees who unleashed catastrophic damage upon their employers, all for their own personal gain.

Thus, the developer hiring process at most big companies is paranoid as heck. Maybe it should be. But unfortunately, this makes it harder for *everyone* to get a developer job – even the most honest of candidates.

As developers, we need proof that our skills are as strong as we say they are. We need proof that our work ethic is as steadfast as our employers need it to be.

That's where reputation comes in. It reduces ambiguity. It reduces counter-party risk. It makes it safer for employers to make a job offer, and to sign an employment contract with you.

This means that – if you have a strong enough reputation – you may be able to get into the company through a side door – rather than the front door that other applicants line up for.

Some companies even have in-house recruiters who can fast track your interview process. A strong reputation can also help you command more bargaining power during salary negotiations.

So let's talk about how you can build a strong reputation, and become sought-after by managers.

### How to Build Your Reputation as a Developer

There are at least six time-tested ways you can build your reputation as a developer. These are:

1. Hackathons
2. Contributing to open source
3. Creating Developer-focused content
4. Rising in the ranks working at companies who have a "household name"
5. Building a portfolio of freelance clients
6. Starting your own open source project, company, or charity

#### How to Find Hackathons and Other Developer Competitions

Hackathons represent the most immediate way to build your reputation, your network, and your coding skills at the same time.

Most hackathons are free, and open to the public. You just need to have the time and the budget to travel.

If you live in a city with lots of hackathons – like San Francisco, New York, Bengaluru, or Beijing – you may be able to commute to the event, then go home and sleep in your own bed.

Even though I lived in Santa Barbara, which only had hackathons once every few months, I did have an old classmate in San Francisco who let me crash on his couch. This gave me access to many more events.

Hackathons used to be hard core events. People would knock back energy drinks and sleep on floors, all to finish their project by pitch time.

But hackathon organizers are gradually becoming more mindful about the health and sustainability of these events. After all, a lot of participants have kids, or demanding full-time jobs, and can't just all-out code for an entire weekend.

The best way to find upcoming events is to just google "hackathon [your city name]" and browse the various event calendars that come up. Many of these will be run by universities, local employers, or even education-focused charities.

If you're playing to win, I recommend doing your research ahead of time.

Who are the event sponsors? Usually it will be Business-to-Developer type companies, with APIs, database tools, or various Software-as-a-Service offerings.

These sponsors will probably have a booth at the event where you can talk with their developer advocates. These are people who get paid to teach people how to use the company's tools. Sometimes you'll even meet key employees or founders at these booths, which can be a great networking opportunity, too.

Often the hackathon will offer sponsor-specific prizes. "Best Use of the [sponsor's] API." It may be easier to focus your time on incorporating specific sponsor tools into your project, rather than trying to win the grand prize. You can still put these down as wins on your LinkedIn or your résumé. A win is a win.

Sometimes the hackathon is just so high profile – or the prize is so substantial – that is just makes sense to try and win the competition outright.

During my time going to hackathons, I was able to win several month's rent worth of cash prizes, several years' worth of free co-working space, and even a private tour of the United Nations building in New York City.

On the circuit, I met people whose main source of income was cash prizes from winning hackathons. One dev I knew managed to win nine sponsor prizes at the same hackathon. He managed to integrate all of those sponsor tools into his project – and also win second place overall.

Don't be surprised if some of the people you run into frequently at hackathons go on to found venture-backed companies, or launch prominent open source projects.

The level of ambition you'll see among hackathon regulars is way, way higher than that of the average developer. These are, after all, people who finish a work week, then go straight into a work weekend. These people are not afraid to leap out of the frying pan and into the fire.

### How to Contribute to Open Source

Contributing to open source is one of the most immediate ways you can build your reputation. Most employers are going to look at your GitHub profile, which will prominently display your Git commit history.

![raisedadead__Mrugesh_Mohapatra__--](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/raisedadead__Mrugesh_Mohapatra__--.png)The GitHub profile of Mrugesh Mohapatra, who does a ton of platform development and DevOps for freeCodeCamp.org. Note how green his activity bar is. 2,208 contributions in the past year alone.

Many open source project maintainers, such as Linux Foundation, Mozilla (Firefox), and of course freeCodeCamp ourselves, have high standards for code quality.

You can read through open GitHub issues to find known bugs or feature requests. Then you can make the code changes and open a pull request. If the maintainers merge your pull request, this will be a major feather in your cap.

One of the best ways to get a job at a tech company is to become a prolific open source contributor to their repositories.

Open source contribution is a great way to build your reputation because everything you do is right out in public. And you get the **social proof** of having other developers review and accept your work.

If you're interested in building your reputation through open source, here's how to get started.

Read Hillary Nyakundi's comprehensive guide to [getting started with open source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-beginners-guide/).

### How to Create Developer-Focused Content

Developers are people. And like other people, they want something to do with their time when they're not working, sleeping, or hanging with friends and family.

For many people – including myself – that means spending time in other people's thoughts. Books. Video essays. Interactive experiences like [visual novels](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-rpg-1-5-update/).

You can broadly refer to these as "content." I'm not a huge fan of the word, because it makes these works feel disposable. But that's what people call it.

Software development is an incredibly broad field, with so many different topics you could approach. There are developer lifestyle vlogs, coding interview prep tutorials, coding live streams on Twitch, and developer interview podcasts.

There are probably entire categories of developer content that we haven't even thought of yet, which will break over the next decade.

If you're interested in film, journalism, or creative writing, developer content may be a good way to build your reputation.

You can pick a specific topic and gradually come to be seen as the expert.

There are developers who specialize in tutorials for specific technology stacks, for example.

My friend Andrew Brown is a former CTO from Toronto who has passed all the major DevOps exams. He creates [free courses to prepare you for all the AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud certifications](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/azure-developer-certification-az-204-pass-the-exam-with-this-free-13-5-hour-course/), and also runs an exam prep service.

There are more than 20 million software developers around the world. That's a lot of people who will potentially consume your content, and who will come to know who you are.

### How to Rise in the Ranks Working at Big Companies

You may have seen a developer introduced as an "Ex-Googler" or an "Ex-Netflix engineer."

Some tech companies have such rigorous hiring processes – and such high standards – that even getting a job at the company is a big accomplishment.

There are some practical reasons why employers look at where candidates have previously worked. It reduces the risk of a bad hire.

You can build up your reputation by working your way up the prestige hierarchy. You can ladder from a local employer to a Fortune 500 company, and ultimately to one of the big tech giants.

Of course, working at a giant corporation is not for everyone. I'll talk about this more in Chapter 4. But know that it is one option you have for building up your reputation.

### How to Build your Reputation by Building a Portfolio of Freelance Clients

You can build your reputation by working with companies as a freelancer.

Freelance developers usually work on smaller one-person projects. So this may be a better strategy for building your reputation locally.

For example, if you did good work for a locally-based bank, that may be enough to convince a local law firm to contract you as well.

There is something to be said for being a "hometown hero." I know many developers who can effectively compete with online competition just by being physically present in meetings, and knowing people locally.

### How to Build a Developer Portfolio of Your Work

Once you've built some projects, you'll want to show them off. And the best way to do this is with short videos.

People are busy. They don't have time to pull down your code and run it on their own computer.

And if you send people to a website, they may not fully grasp what they're looking at, and why it's so special.

That's why I recommend you use a screen capture tool to recording 2 minute video demos.

Two minutes should be long enough to show how the project works. And once you've done that, you can explain some of the implementation details, and design decisions you made.

But always, always start with the demo. People want to see something work. They want to see something visual.

Once you've lured people in with your compelling demo of your app running, you can explain all the details you want. Your audience will now have more context, and be more interested.

Two minutes is also a magic length, because you can upload that video to a tweet, and it will auto-play on Twitter as people scroll past it. Auto-play videos are much, much more likely to be watched on Twitter. They remove the friction of having to click a play button, or navigate to another website.

A video demo of a twitter clone project, built by a freeCodeCamp alumni. This one has no voice-over explanation, and is 2 minutes of UI demo. But it's still really good.

You can can put these project demo videos on websites like YouTube, Twitter, your GitHub profile, and of course your own portfolio website.

For capturing this video, I recommend using QuickTime, which comes built-in with MacOS. And if you're on Windows, you can use Game Recorder, which comes free in Windows 10.

And if you want a more powerful tool, OBS is free and open source. It's harder to learn, but infinitely customizable.

As far as recording tips: keep your font size as large as possible, and use an external mic. Any mic you can find – even from cheap headphones – will be better than speaking into your laptop's built in mic.

Invest as much time as you need to in recording and re-recording takes until you nail it.

Being able to demo your projects and present your code is a valuable skill you'll use throughout your career. Time spent practicing pitching is never wasted.

### How to Start Your Own Open Source Project, Company, or Charity

Being a founder is the fastest – but also riskiest – way to build a reputation as a developer.

It's riskiest because you're wagering your time, your money, and possibly even your personal relationships – all for an unknown outcome.

If you contribute to open source for long enough, you *will* build a reputation as a developer.

If you grind the hackathon circuit for long enough, you *will* build a reputation as a developer*.*

But you could attempt to start entrepreneurial projects for decades without getting traction. And squander your time, money, and connections along the way.

Entrepreneurship is beyond the scope of this book. But if you're interested in it, I will give you this quick advice:

Entrepreneur is a French word that essentially translates to "one who bears risk."

Most entrepreneurs fail. Some fail due to circumstances outside their control. But a lot fail due to not understanding the nature of the risks they're taking on.

Don't rush into founding a project, company, or charity. Try to work for other organizations who are already doing work in your field of interest.

By working for someone else, you get paid to learn. You get exposure to the work, and the risks surrounding it. And you can build savings for an eventual entrepreneurial venture.

## How Not to Destroy Your Reputation

> "It takes a lifetime to build a good reputation, but you can lose it in a minute." – Will Rogers, Actor, Cowboy, and one of my heroes growing up in Oklahoma City

Building your reputation is a marathon, not a sprint.

It may take years to build up a reputation strong enough to open the right doors.

But just like in a competitive marathon, a stumble can cost you valuable time. A stumble that results in injury may put you out of the race completely.

### Don't Say Dumb Things on the Internet

People used to say dumb things all the time. The words might hang in the air for a few minutes while everyone winced. But the words did eventually dissipate.

Now when people say dumb things, they often do so online. And in indelible ink.

Always assume that the moment you type something into a website and press enter, it's going to be saved to a database. That database is going to be backed up across several data centers around the world.

You can prove the existence of data, but there is no way to prove the absence of data.

You should assume, for all intents and purposes, that the cat is out of the bag. There's no getting the cat back in the bag. Whatever you just said: that's on your permanent record.

You can delete the remark. You can delete your account. You can even try to scrub it from Google search results. But someone has probably already backed it up on the Wayback Machine. And when one of those databases inevitably gets hacked years from now, those data will probably still be in there somewhere, ready to resurfaced.

It is a scary time to be a loud mouth. So don't be. Think before you speak.

My advice, which may sound cowardly: get out of the habit of arguing with people online.

Some people abide by the playground rule of "if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all."

I prefer the "praise in public, criticize in private."

I will publicly recognize good work someone is doing in the developer community. If I see a project that impresses me, I will say so.

But I generally refrain from tearing people down. Even people who deserve it.

In a fight, everyone looks dirty.

You don't want to look wrathful, tearing apart someone's argument, or dog piling in on someone who just said something dumb.

Sure – caustic wit can win you internet points in the short term. But it can also make people love you a little bit less and fear you a little bit more.

I also try to refrain from complaining. Yes, I could probably get better customer service if I threatened to tweet about a cancelled flight.

But people are busy. Most of them don't want to use their scarce time, scrolling through social media, only to see me groaning about what is in the grand scheme of things a mild inconvenience.

So that is my advice on using social media. Try to keep it positive.

If it's a matter that you believe strongly about, I won't stop you from speaking your mind. Just think before you type, and think before you hit send.

### Don't Over-promise and Under-deliver

One of the most common ways I see developers torpedo their own reputations is to over-promise and under-deliver. This is not necessarily a fatal error. But it is bad.

Remember when I talked about the Las Vegas hackathon where I utterly failed to finish the project in time for the pitch, and we had to use slides instead of a working app?

Yeah, that was one of the lowest points in my learn to code journey. My teammates were polite, but I'm sure they were disappointed in me. After all, I had been overconfident. I had over-promised what I'd be able to achieve in that time frame, and I had under-delivered.

It is much better to be modest in your estimations of your abilities.

Remember the parable of Icarus, who on wax wings flew too close to the sun. If only he'd taken a more measured approach. Ascended a bit slower. Then his wings wouldn't have melted, and he wouldn't have plunged into the sea, leaving a guilt-stricken father.

![1690px-Pieter_Bruegel_de_Oude_-_De_val_van_Icarus](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/1690px-Pieter_Bruegel_de_Oude_-_De_val_van_Icarus.jpg)Landscape with the Fall of Icarus by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, circa 1560. Icarus coulda been a contender. He coulda been somebody. But instead, he's just legs disappearing into the sea. And the farmers and the shepherds can't be bothered to look up from their work to take in his insignificance.

### Get Addictions Under Control Before They Damage Your Reputation

If you have an untreated drug, alcohol, or gambling addiction, seek help first. The developer job search can be a long, grueling one. You want to go into it with your full attention.

Even something as seemingly harmless as video game addiction can distract you, and soak up too much of your time. It's worth getting it under control first.

I am not a doctor. And I'm not going to give you a "drugs are bad" speech. But I will say: you may hear of Silicon Valley fads, where developers abuse drugs thinking they can somehow improve their coding or problem solving abilities.

For a while there was a "micro-dosing LSD" trend. There was a pharmaceutical amphetamines trend.

My gut reaction to that is: any edge these may give you is probably unsustainable, and a net negative over a longer time period.

Don't feel peer pressure to take psychoactive drugs. Don't feel peer pressure to drink at happy hours. (I haven't drank so much as a beer since my daughter was born 7 years ago, and I don't feel like I've missed out on anything at all.)

If you are in recovery from addiction, be mindful that learning to code and getting a developer job will be a stressful process. Pace yourself, so you don't risk a relapse.

You do not want to reach the end of the career transition process – and achieve so much – only to have old habits resurface and undo your hard work.

### Try and Separate Your Professional Life From Your Personal Life

You may have heard the expression, "Don't mix business with pleasure."

As a developer, you are going to become a powerful person. You are going to command a certain degree of respect from other people in your city.

Maybe not as much as a doctor or an astronaut. But still. People are going to look up to you.

You are going to talk with people who would love to be in your shoes.

Do not flaunt your wealth.

Do not act as though you're smarter than everybody else.

Do not abuse the power dynamic to get what you want in relationships.

This will make you unlikable to the people around you. And if it's somehow captured and posted online, it may go on to haunt you for the rest of your career.

Never lose sight of how much you have. And how much you have to lose.

### Use the Narrator Trick

I'll close this chapter with a little trick I use to pump myself up.

First, remember that you are the hero in your own coding journey. In the theater of your mind, you are the person everyone's watching – the one they are rooting for.

The Narrator Trick is to narrate your actions in your head as you do them.

> Quincy strides across the hackerspace, his laptop tucked under his arm. He sets his mug under the hot water dispenser and drops in a fresh tea bag. He pulls back the lever. And as the steaming water fills his mug, he says aloud in his best British accent: "Tea. Earl Grey. Hot."
>
> His energizing beverage in hand, he slides into a booth, squares his laptop on the surface, and catches the glance of a fellow developer. They lock eyes for a second. Quincy bows his head ever-so-slightly, acknowledging the dev's presence. The dev bows back, almost telepathically sharing this sentiment: "I see you friend. I see you showing up. I see you getting things done."

This may sound ridiculous. Why yes, it is ridiculous. But I do it all the time. And it works.

Narrating even the most mundane moments of your life in your head can help energize you. Crystalize the moment laid out before you, and give you clarity of purpose.

And this works even better when you think of your life in terms of eras ("the Taco Bell years"). Or inflection points ("passing the GED exam").

What does this have to do with building your reputation? Your reputation is essentially the summary of who you are. What you mean to people around you.

By taking yourself more seriously, by thinking about your life as a movie, you're gradually working through who you are. And who you one day want to be.

By narrating your actions, you shine a brighter light on them in your own mind. Why did I just do that? What was I thinking? Was there a better move there?

So many people sabotage their reputations without even realizing it, just because they've settled into bad habits.

For years I thought I had to be "funny" all the time. I would find any opportunity to inject some self-deprecating humor. A lot of people realized what I was doing and found it amusing. But a lot of them didn't understand, and just got the impression I was a jerk.

Why did I do that? I think it went back to grade school, when I was always trying to be the class clown and make people laugh.

But decades later, this reflex to fill silence with laughter was not serving me well.

> "When you repeat a mistake, it's not a mistake anymore. It's a decision." – Paulo Coelho

I might have gone on much longer without noticing this bad habit. But with the Narrator Trick, the awkwardness of my behavior was laid bare.

I'm sure I've got lots of other ways of thinking and ways of doing things that are suboptimal. And with the help of the Narrator Trick, I'm hoping to identify them in the future and refine them, before they give people the wrong impression.

### Your Reputation Will Become Your Legacy.

Think about who you want to be at the end of your story. How you want people to think of your time on Earth. Then work backward from there.

The person you want to be at the end of the movie. That hero you want people to admire. Why not start carrying yourself like that now?

Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To have built software systems that people rely upon?

That future you – how would they think? How would they approach situations and solve problems? How would they talk about their accomplishments? Their setbacks?

Merely thinking about your future self can help you clarify your thinking. Your priorities.

I often think of "Old Man Quincy", with his bad back. He has to excuse himself to run to the toilet every 30 minutes.

But Old Man Quincy still tries his best to work with what he has. He moves in spite of sore joints. He ponders in spite of a foggy mind.

Old Man Quincy still wants to get things done. He's proud of what he's accomplished, but he doesn't spend much time looking back. He looks forward at what he's going to do that day, and what goals he's going to accomplish.

I often think about Old Man Quincy, and work backward to where I am today.

What decisions can I make today that will set me up for being someone worthy of admiration tomorrow? Do I have to wait decades to earn that reputation? Or can I borrow some of that respect from the future?

By thinking like my future self might think, can I make moves that earn me a positive reputation in the present?

I believe that you can leverage your future reputation – your legacy – right now. Just think in terms of your future self and what you'll accomplish. And use that as a waypoint to guide you forward.

I hope that these tools – the Narrator Trick and the visualizing your future self trick – help you not only think about the nature of reputation. I hope they also help you take concrete steps toward improving your reputation.

Because building a reputation – making a name for yourself – is the surest path to sustainable success as a developer.

Success can mean many things to many people. But most people – from most cultures – would agree: one big aspect of success is putting food on the table for yourself and your family.

And that's what we're going to talk about next.

## Chapter 4: How to Get Paid to Code – Freelance Clients and the Job Search

If you've been building your skills, your network, and your reputation, then getting a developer job is not all that complicated.

Note that I said it's not complicated – it's still a lot of work. And it can be a grind.

First, let me tell you how I got my first job.

### Story Time: How Did a Teacher in His 30s Get His First Developer Job?

*Last time on Story Time: Quincy hit the hackathon circuit hard, even winning a few of the events. He was building his reputation as a developer who was "dangerous" with JavaScript. Not super skilled. Just dangerous...*

I had just finished a long day of learning at the Santa Barbara downtown library, sipping tea and building projects.

The best thing about living in California is the weather. We'd joke that when you rented an exorbitantly-priced one-bedroom apartment in the suburbs, you were not paying for the inside – you were paying for the outside.

My goal was to spend as little time in that cramped 100-year old rat trap as necessary, and to spend the rest out walking around town.

It was a beautiful Wednesday evening. I still had two more days to prepare for that weekend's hackathon. And my brain was completely fried from the day of coding. My wife was working late, so I checked my calendar to find something to do.

On the first Monday of each month, I would map out all that month's upcoming tech events around southern California, so I'd always have a tech event I could attend if I had the energy.

Ah – tonight is the Santa Barbara Ruby on Rails meetup, and I had already RSVP'd.

I didn't know a lot about Ruby on Rails, but I had completed a few small projects with it. I was much more of a JavaScript and Python developer.

But I figured, what the heck. I need to keep up my momentum with building my network. And the venue was just a few blocks away.

I walked in and it was just a few devs sitting around a table chatting. It quickly became clear that they all worked together at a local startup, maintaining a large Ruby on Rails codebase. Most of them had been working there for several years.

Now at this point, I'd spent the past year building my skills, my network, and my reputation. So I was able to hold my own during the conversation.

But I also had a feel for the limits of my abilities. So I stayed modest. Understated. The way I'd seen so many other successful developers maneuver a conversation at tech events.

It became clear that one of the developers at the table was the Director of Engineering. He reported directly to the CTO.

And then it became clear that they were looking to hire Ruby on Rails developers.

I was candid about my background and my abilities. "My background is in adult education. Teaching English and running schools. I just started learning to code about a year ago."

But he was surprisingly unfazed. "Well if you want to come in for an interview, we can see whether you'd be a good fit for the team."

That night I walked home feeling an electricity. It was much more dread than excitement.

I felt nowhere near ready. And I wasn't even looking for a job. I was just living off my savings, learning to code full-time, with health insurance through my wife's job.

I was a compulsive saver. People would give me a hard time about it. I would change my own oil, cut my own hair, and even cook my own rice at home when we ordered takeout – just to save a few bucks.

Over the decade that I'd worked as a teacher, I'd managed to save nearly a quarter of my after-tax earnings. And I would buy old video games on Craigslist, then flip them on eBay. That may sound silly, but it was a substantial source of income for me.

What were we saving all this for? We weren't sure. Maybe to buy a house in California at some point in the future? But it meant that I did not have to hustle to get a job. I knew I was in a privileged position, and I tried to make the most of it by learning more every day.

So in short, I didn't think I was ready for my first developer job. And I was worried that if they hired me, it would be a big mistake. They would realize how inexperienced I was, fire me, and then I'd have to explain that failure during future job interviews.

Of course, I now know I was looking at this opportunity the wrong way. But let me finish the story.

When I scheduled my job interview, they asked me for a résumé. I wasn't sure what to do, so I left all my professional experience there. All the schools I'd worked for over the years. (I left off my time running the drive-thru at Taco Bell.)

Of course, none of my work experience had anything to do with coding. But what was I supposed to do, hand them a blank sheet of paper?

Well, I did have an online portfolio of projects I'd built. And most importantly, I had a list of all the hackathons I'd won or placed in. So I included those.

I spent the final hours before the interview revisiting all the Ruby on Rails tutorials I'd used over the past year, to refresh my memory. And then I put on my hoody, jeans, and backpack, and walked over to their office.

The office manager was a nice lady who took me back to the developer bullpen and introduced me to their small team of devs. There were maybe a dozen of them, most of them dressed in jeans and hoodies, aged from early 20s to late 40s. Two of them were women.

I took turns navigating the tangle of desks and cables, shaking hands with each of them and introducing myself. This is where all my experience as a classroom teacher memorizing student names came in handy. I was able to remember all their names, so that later in the day when I left I could follow up with each of them: "Great meeting you [name]. I'd be excited to work alongside you."

First I met with the director of engineering. We went into a small office and closed the door.

A whiteboard on the wall was covered in sketches of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. A rainbow of dry-erase marker laid out the relationships between various servers and services.

I kept glancing at that whiteboard, fearing that he'd send me over to it to solve some sort coding problems and demonstrate my skills. Maybe the famous fizzbuzz problem? Maybe he'd want me to invert a binary tree?

But he never even mentioned the whiteboard. He just sat there looking intensely at me the whole time.

They were a company of about 50 employees, with lots of venture capital funding, and thousands of paying customers – mostly small businesses. They prided themselves on being pragmatic. At no point did they inquire about what I studied in school, or what kind of work I did in the past. All they really cared about was...

"Look. I know you can code," he said. "You've been coding this whole time, winning hackathons. I checked out some of your portfolio projects. The code quality was OK for someone who's new to coding. So for me, the real question is – can you learn how we do things here? Can you work with the other devs on the team? And most critically: can you get things done?"

I gulped, leaned forward, and mustered all the confidence I could. "Yes," I said. "I believe I can."

And he said, "Good. Good. OK. Go wait in the Pho restaurant downstairs. [The CTO] should be down there in a minute."

So I talked with the CTO over noodles. Mostly listened. I'd learned that people project intelligence on quiet people. Listening intently not only helps you get smarter – it even makes you looks smarter.

And the approach worked. The meeting lasted about an hour. The noodles were tasty. I learned a lot about the company history, and the near-term goals. The CTO said, "OK go back up and talk with [the director of engineering]."

And I did. And he offered me a job.

Now, I want to emphasize. This is not how most people get their first developer job.

You're probably thinking, "Gee, here Quincy is Forest Gumping his way into a developer job that he wasn't even looking for. If only we could all be so lucky"

And that's certainly what it felt like for me at the time. But in the next section, I'm going to explore the relationship between employers and developers. And how me landing that job was less about my skills as an interviewee, and more about the year of coding, networking, and reputation building that preceded it.

This wasn't a cushy job at a big tech company, with all the compensation, benefits, and company bowling alleys. It was a contractor role that paid about the same as I was making as a teacher.

But it was a developer job. A company was paying me to write code.

I was now a professional developer.

### What Employers Want

Flash forward a decade. I have now been on both sides of the table. I've been interviewed by hiring managers as a developer. I've interviewed developers as a hiring manager.

I've spent many hours on calls with developers who are in the middle of the job search. Some of them have applied to hundreds of jobs and gotten only a few "call-backs" for job interviews.

I've also spent many hours on calls with managers and recruiters, trying to better understand how they hire and what they look for.

I think much of the frustration developers feel about the hiring process comes down to a misunderstanding.

Employers value one thing above all else: predictability.

Which of these candidates do you think an employer would prefer?

**X** is a "rockstar" 10x coder who often has flashes of genius. X also has bursts of incredible productivity. But X is often grumpy with colleagues, and often misses deadlines or meetings.

**Y** is an OK coder, and has slower but more consistent output. Y gets along fine with colleagues, and rarely misses meetings or deadlines.

**Z** is similar to Y in output, and able to get along well with colleagues and meet deadlines. But Z has changed jobs 3 times in the past 3 years.

OK, you can probably guess from everything I've said up to this point: **Y** is the preferred candidate. And that is because employers value predictability above all else.

**X** is a trap candidate that some first-time managers may make the mistake of hiring. If you are curious why hiring X would be such a bad idea, read [We fired our top talent. Best decision we ever made.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde/)

I only added **Z** to this list to make a point: try not to change jobs too often.

You can increase your income pretty quickly by laddering from employer to employer. You can start applying for new jobs the moment you accept an offer letter. But this will repel many hiring managers.

After all, the rolling stone gathers no moss. You will be in and out of codebases before you have the time to understand how they work.

Consider this: it can take 6 months or longer for a manager to bring a new developer up to speed, to the point where they can be a net positive for the team.

Until that point, the new hire is essentially a drain on company resources, absorbing time and energy from their peers who have to onboard them, help them find their way around a codebase, and fix their bugs.

### Most Employers are Risk Averse

Let's say a manager hires the wrong developer. Take a moment to think about how bad that can be for the team.

On average, it takes about 3 months to fill a developer position at a company. Employers have to first:

- get the budget to hire a developer approved by their bosses
- create the job description
- post the job on job sites and communicate with recruiters
- sift through résumés – many of which will be low-effort from candidates who are blindly applying to as many jobs as possible
- start the interviewing process, which may involve flying the candidates out to the city and lodging them in a hotel
- rounds of interviews involving lots of other team members. For some employers, this is a multi-day affair
- selecting a final candidate, and negotiating an offer...
- which many candidates will not accept anyway
- signing contracts and onboarding the employee
- giving them access to sensitive internal systems
- introducing them to their teammates, and making sure everyone gets along OK
- and then months of informal training, when the employee needs to understand a service or a part of a legacy codebase
- steeping them in the team's way of doing things

In short – a lot of work.

Now imagine that after doing all that, the new employee says "Hey, I just got a higher offer from this other company. Peace out, yo."

Or imagine that the employee is unreliable, and often shows up hours after the workday has started.

Or imagine that the employee struggles with untreated drug, alcohol, or gambling addiction, anger issues – or just turns out to be a passive aggressive person who undermines the team.

Now you have to start this entire process over again, and search for a new candidate for the position.

Hiring is hard.

So you can see why employers are risk averse. Many of them will pass over seemingly qualified candidates until they find someone whom they feel 99% sure about.

### 因为雇主非常厌恶风险，所以求职者受苦

如果你现在认为招聘很困难，你一定不知道工作申请流程有多复杂。你或许已经对它再熟悉不过了。就像这样……

- 你必须准备简历。同时，你将在整个求职过程中不断地摸索着做决定。
- 你必须在网上四处寻找职位空缺，研究雇主，并且评估他们是否适合你。
- 大多数职位的申请都需要填表，你将不得不一遍又一遍地重新填写简历，希望表单不会因服务器错误或 JavaScript 验证错误而崩溃。
- 提交这些工作申请后，你必须等待雇主处理它们。有一些雇主并不会人工审阅所有申请，因为他们收到的申请实在太多了。（比如谷歌每天能收到 9000 份申请。）雇主会使用软件来筛选。内部招聘人员 [平均只花6秒查看每份简历](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/you-in-6-seconds-how-to-write-a-resume-that-employers-will-actually-read-fd7757740802/)。通常你的申请甚至永远不会被人工审阅。
- 你可能永远不会收到公司的任何回复。他们几乎没有动机告诉你他们为什么拒绝你（他们不希望你提起歧视诉讼）。如果你幸运的话，你会收到一封“我们已经决定选择其他候选人”的电子邮件。
- 所有你花在申请这些工作上的时间——可能是每周几个小时——是消耗精力的，当然，也是无偿的。

是吧。所以你可以看到招聘过程对雇主，尤其对求职者来说都是一场噩梦。

但如果你坚持下去，你最终可以拿到一些 offer。毕竟好运也是连着来的。

以下是一位 freeCodeCamp 贡献者在12周内的求职数据：

![85L921BMzXxKhVySPo9gxWamr5J4QLFJaVEn](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/85L921BMzXxKhVySPo9gxWamr5J4QLFJaVEn.png)

在投递了291份申请之后，他最终收到了8个 offer。

随着 offer 的陆续到来，起薪也越来越高。当然，请注意，这是在世界上消费水平最高的城市之一——旧金山的工作。

![bDp3eVv6VQS3Og3ulVpwp6dDylIybdpRczsD](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/bDp3eVv6VQS3Og3ulVpwp6dDylIybdpRczsD.png)

到第12周时，在他收到的 offer 里，起薪几乎是第2周的两倍。

这位开发者得到面试的几率相当高。而且他的谈判能力也很强。如果你感兴趣，可以[在这里](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/5-key-learnings-from-the-post-bootcamp-job-search-9a07468d2331/)了解更多关于他求职过程的内容。

但正如我之前所说，其实从“旁门”进入一家公司会更容易一些。

这就是我写这本书的原因之一。我不希望你们都在雇主的“前门”排队。

### 如果你建立了自己的技能、人脉和声誉，你就可以绕过很多工作申请流程。

在本书中，我一直在教你一些增加“走运”获得工作机会可能性的技巧。

> “运气是准备遇见机会。如果你在机会来临时没有做好准备，你就不会'幸运'。” —— 奥普拉·温弗瑞

这就是为什么在整本书中我都鼓励你同时发展这三个领域，并且从第一天起就开始考虑它们——在你找工作之前。

我没有特意找工作但却找到了工作的故事可能看起来有点蠢。但这种情况发生的频率可能比你想象的要高。

现实是：学习编程很困难。

但是知道如何编程很重要。

在每个行业中——几乎在世界上的每个公司中——管理者们都在试图找到将他们的流程软件化的方法。

这就意味着需要开发人员。

你可能听说过科技行业偶尔会出现大规模裁员。 但是，如果你缩小并查看更长的时间线，开发人员的招聘趋势无疑是增长的。

我希望凭借优秀的技能、强大的人脉和良好的声誉，你将额外耗费最少的精力并找到一份好工作。

希望在我们有生之年的某一天，雇主和有技能的员工可以更容易地找到彼此，而无需漫长、残酷的工作申请和面试过程。

### 我应该在第一份开发工作谈判薪资吗？

只要你礼貌地进行谈判沟通，尝试提高你的薪水通常不会有什么坏处。

我写过一篇更详细的关于[如何进行开发工作的薪资谈判](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/salary-negotiation-how-not-to-set-a-bunch-of-money-on-fire-605aabbaf84b/)的文章。

从本质上讲，谈判更高的起薪取决于你有多少能力。

你的雇主有工作要完成。他们有多需要你来为他们工作？他们还有什么其他选择？

而你需要收入来生活。你有什么其他的选择？你的备选计划是什么？

如果你有另一家雇主提供的工作机会，并且愿意支付某个金额的薪水，你可以将其作为谈判薪资的筹码。

如果你的最佳后备计划是回到学校并获得研究生学位……那不算特别强大的筹码，但总比没有好。你可以在薪资谈判的过程中提到它。

回想一下我之前描述的漫长的招聘过程。雇主必须经过至少十几个步骤才能与候选人到达将要发放 offer 的那一步。他们可能已经预料到你会进行薪资谈判，并不会对此感到惊讶。

现在，如果你和我一样，有家公司突然给你一份工作，你可能会觉得谈判薪资很尴尬。

![92508](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/92508.jpeg)

《辛普森一家》里的史密瑟斯

我承认——在我上面写的故事里，当我的经理给我这份工作时，我没有谈判。

回想起来，我本应该协商我的报酬吗？也许吧。

我有什么筹码吗？可能不多。我的备选计划是继续参加编程比赛，在公共图书馆喝茶和写代码。

我也许能去谈判并每小时多赚几美元。但在他们给我那份工作的那一刻，报酬是我最后才考虑到的事情。我只是欣喜若狂，因为我即将成为一名专业的开发人员。

顺便说一句，一旦你在一家公司担任开发人员一年左右，你可能会想要求加薪。我已经写了更详细的关于[作为开发人员如何要求加薪](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/youre-underpaid-here-s-how-you-can-get-the-pay-raise-you-deserve-fafcf52956d6/)的文章。但归根结底都是同一件事：谈判筹码。

### 你应该找猎头帮忙搜寻开发职位吗？

是的。如果你能找到一位猎头来帮助你找到第一份开发工作，那么你应该这样做。

我已经写过关于[为什么猎头是你找工作时被低估的工具](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-tech-recruiter-red-pill-967dd492560c/)的文章。

许多雇主会向猎头支付中介费，用以向他们输送高质量的求职者。

猎头的目标和奖励机制与作为求职者的你完全一致：

1. 他们将根据你的起薪获得报酬，因此他们倾向于帮助你协商到尽可能高的起薪。
2. 他们成功输送的候选人越多——输送的速度越快——他们赚的钱就越多。所以他们会希望帮助你尽快找到工作，这样他们就可以转向其他求职者。
3. 因为他们只有在你成为一名正式员工（并且至少待90天）后才会得到报酬，所以他们会努力确保你能胜任这份工作，并且适合公司的文化。

话说回来，如果猎头要求你为任何事情付钱给他们，那就是危险信号。

并不是所有的猎头都是相同的。在与猎头合作之前先做个调查。即使他们最终得到了雇主的报酬，你仍然在花时间帮助他们的工作。时间是很宝贵的。

说到时间，有一种可以让你更快达到写代码获得报酬的方法——即便你还在为求职做准备——做一些自由开发者的工作。

### 如何找到自由客户

我鼓励初级开发人员在开始找工作之前尝试获得一些自由客户。这里有三个很好的理由：

1. 获得自由客户比找到全职工作要容易得多。
2. 自由职业的风险较小，因为你可以在不辞去日常工作的情况下进行。
3. 你可以更快地开始通过写代码获得报酬，并更快地开始构建你的专业作品集。

获得自由客户比找到开发工作要容易得多。这是为什么？

想想当地的小型企业。它可能只是一个经营餐馆、商店、管道公司或者律师事务所的家庭。

这些企业中有多少可以从交互式网站、后台管理系统和工具中受益，以自动化他们的日常工作流程呢？答案当然是他们中的大多数。

然而这些公司中有多少能够聘请全职软件开发人员来构建和维护这些系统呢？没有那么多。

这就是自由职业者的用武之地。使用他们更加经济实惠。小型企业可以为单个项目或短期聘请自由职业者。

如果你正在积极建立你的人脉，你遇到的一些人可能会成为你的客户。

例如，你可能会遇到一位想要更新其网站的本地会计师，他可能想添加安排咨询或接受信用卡支付的能力。这些是小型企业可能要求的常见功能，你可能会非常擅长实现它们。

你可能还会遇到需要 ERP 系统、CRM 系统、库存系统或无数其他工具之一的小型企业的管理者。

在许多情况下，你可以为他们部署和配置一个开源工具。然后你可以教他们如何使用那个系统。你可以按月向他们收取服务费，让你“随叫随到”并准备好解决可能出现的问题。

### 我应该签订自由职业合同吗？

你需要找到一个标准的合同模板，修改它，然后请律师批准。

让当地的面包店与你签订合同只是为了帮助更新他们的网站或社交媒体形象，这可能会让人感到尴尬。但这样做会让整个交易比单纯的握手协议更专业。

一家小企业不太可能会因为几千美元而将你告上法庭。但如果发生这种情况，你会很高兴自己签了合同。

### 我应该为自由职业的工作收取多少费用？

我会计算出你日常工作的时薪，然后加倍。这听起来可能是很多钱，但自由职业比常规工作要难得多。你必须学习很多东西。

或者，你可以以单个项目为单位计费。 “我将以1000美元的价格为你部署和配置此系统。”

请务必指定你愿意维护项目的时间范围。你不希望人们在3年后打电话给你，希望你回来修复一个没有人维护的系统。

### 我如何确保自由客户会付钱给我？

很多其他的自由职业者——包括我自己——都使用这种简单的方法：在开始工作之前预先索取一半的报酬。当你能证明你已经完成了一半时，就要求他们支付另一半。

尽量在你真正完成项目之前拿到所有报酬，这样，客户就无法用未支付的报酬来试图让你做额外的工作。

如果你已经得到全额报酬，那么你之后为客户所做的工作将传达这个意思：“我为你付出了更多。”

这带来了一种完全不同的气氛：“啊哦——你会为我做的所有工作付钱给我吗？”

### 我应该使用像 Upwork 或者 Fiverr 这样的自由职业网站吗？

如果你在一些偏远地区并且在当地找不到任何客户，你可以尝试其中的一些自由职业网站。但除此之外，我不会关注它们。原因如下：

当你尝试在自由职业网站上找兼职工作时，你是在与世界各地的所有自由职业者竞争。他们中的许多人居住在生活成本比你低得多的城市。他们中的一些人甚至不会像你一样真正关心自己的声誉，并且可能愿意接受低于标准报酬的工作。

在某种程度上，这些网站助长了一种“逐底竞争”现象，即提供最廉价劳动力的人通常会得到这份工作。

如果你转而专注于通过自己的本地人际关系寻找客户，你将不必与这些国外的自由职业者竞争。

需要寻求自由开发者帮助的人也是如此。 如果你想雇用一名自由职业者，我强烈建议你与可以见到面的人一起工作，他与你的社区有联系。

在你的城市生活了几年，并且与你有很多交集的人——他们不太可能试图占你的便宜。如果你和你的合作方都关心自己的声誉，那么你们会成就一段有效的合作伙伴关系。

你们会可以成为对方履历中的成功故事。

### 我什么时候应该停止自由职业并开始找正式工作？

如果你有能力以自由职业维生，你可能只想继续做下去。慢慢地，你甚至可以建立自己的软件开发机构，并聘请其他开发人员来帮助你。

话说回来，如果你渴望拥有稳定的开发工作，那么你可能很走运。如果你坚持足够长的时间，自由客户可能会给你全职工作。在某些时候，客户以较低的时薪给你提供一份全职工作可能更经济实惠。你得到一份稳定的每周工作40小时的工作，而他们全职获得你的技能。

当你找到工作时，你也可以保留一些自由客户。这是很好的收入补贴。但请记住，正如我们将在下一章中了解到的那样，你的第一份开发工作可能会需要你非常尽职尽责。至少在一开始的时候是这样。

成为职业开发者的第一年会有多疯狂呢？让我们来谈谈这个。

## 第5章：如何在你的第一份开发工作中取得成功

> "待在港口的船很安全。但这不是造船的目的。" —— 格蕾丝·霍珀，数学家，美国海军少将，计算机科学先驱

一旦你获得第一份开发工作，那就是真正学习的开始。

你将学习如何与其他开发人员一起高效工作。

你将学习如何浏览大型遗留代码库。

你将学习版本控制系统、持续集成和持续交付工具 (CI/CD)、项目管理工具等。

你将学习如何在技术管理者手下工作。如何在截止日期前交付。以及如何解决工作中的大量分歧。

最重要的是，你将学会如何管理自己。

你将学习如何突破影响我们所有人的心理障碍，例如冒名顶替综合症。你将了解到自己的极限，以及如何稍微地超越它们。

### 讲故事时间：一名30多岁的教师如何在他的第一份开发工作中取得成功？

*上一次故事时间回顾：昆西在当地一家科技初创公司找到了他的第一份开发工作。他将成为维护一个庞大、复杂的代码库的十几名开发人员中的一员。他不知道自己在做什么……*

我凌晨4点醒来，再也睡不着了。我努力尝试睡着。但是我的胸口像在燃烧一样。焦虑和恐慌包围了我。

我在教育领域工作了十年。先当家教。然后当老师。接着担任校长。

几个小时后，我将从头开始，成为一名开发人员。

我过去的任何学习——过去的成功——对我的新职业来说有什么意义吗？

我做了我感到焦虑时最常做的事——跑步。我跑下山坡，头灯在黑暗中摇晃。当我到达海滩时，太阳慢慢爬上树梢，我沿着大海奔跑。

当我回到家时，我妻子已经出门上班了。她告诉我不要担心。她说，“即使你因为不知道自己在做什么而被解雇，我依然爱你。”

当我到达我的新办公室时，那里没有人。作为一名教师，我习惯于7点30分准时到校。但我很快意识到，大多数软件开发人员并没有那么早开始工作。

所以我盘腿坐在入口走廊上，按照上网本上的教程写代码。

一名员工朝我走来，脸上带着紧张的表情。她可能认为我是一个来占位的闲杂人等。我向她保证我确实在她的公司工作，并说服她让我进去。

穿过空荡荡的开放式办公室走向开发人员工作的区域，我感觉像在做梦，只有出口标志的灯光指引着我的路。

我在一张空的站立式办公桌上设置了我的上网本，并完成了编码教程。

过了一会儿，我周围的灯光亮了起来。我的老板来了。起初他并没在意我的存在。他只是在办公桌前坐下，开始敲击他的机械键盘。

“拉尔森，”他终于开口了。“你准备好迎接你这个重要的第一天了吗？”

我还没准备好。但我想表现出我的信心。所以我说了我最喜欢的 80 年代电影之一《妖魔大闹唐人街》中的第一句台词：“我生来就准备好了。”

![big-trubs-born-ready](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/big-trubs-born-ready.jpeg)

你可能已经听过上百万次“我天生就准备好了”。但这句话最早是在 1986 年杰克·伯顿 (Jack Burton) 对他的朋友王驰 (Wang Chi) 说的，当时他们正准备在他的死亡仓库中与一位千年老巫师对峙。 我不敢相信我的父母当时让我看这个，但我很高兴他们这么做了。

“好极了，”我的老板说。“那么先给你配一台电脑。”

“哦，我已经有了一个，”我敲了敲我200美元的上网本说。“这个宝贝正在运行 Linux Mint，我已经自定义了我的 .emacs 文件，以便能够……”

“我们是一家 Mac 商店，”他说着走向储藏室。他搜寻了一会儿，然后出现了。“这是一个已经用了3年的模型，但它应该还够用。我们把它重置到出厂设置。”

我开始说我已经熟悉我的电脑配置，而且我用它能更快地工作，但他并不接受。

“我们都在使用相同的工具。它使协作变得更加容易。你要知道，惯例优于配置。”

那是我第一次听到“惯例优于配置”这个词，但在接下来的几天里它会出现很多次。

其他开发人员陆续到了公司，而我花了接下来的几个小时来配置我的新电脑。

接近上午10点时，我们开始了团队“站会”。我们站在白板前围成一圈，轮流汇报当天的工作。

每个人都提供简洁、准确的进展更新。

轮到我了，我开始自我介绍。当时我已经非常紧张了，结果这时候迈克走了进来，他是超级马拉松运动员，也主持举办圣塔芭芭拉的初创企业活动。他正在吃一些小胡萝卜，那天早上他已经跑了大约30英里。

在我结束后，迈克说话了，欢迎了我并且说他在一些活动中见过我。然后，他用15秒的时间讲述了有关他正在写一些功能的工作。

整个会议只进行了大约10分钟，大家就各自回到了自己的办公桌。

我最终让公司的代码库在我的新笔记本电脑上运行。这是一个已经发展了5年多的 Ruby on Rails 应用程序。我运行了“rake stats”命令，发现它有数百万行代码。我不寒而栗。我怎么可能能理解这些东西呢？

我的隔壁桌，一个看起来粗鲁的、留着胡子的开发人员说，“嗯，其中大部分只是包。你实际要处理的代码库可能只有100000行。别担心。你会掌握它的窍门的。”

我咽了咽口水，心想：“这还不到一百万呢，还行。”

“顺便说一句，我叫尼克，”他自我介绍道。 “如果你需要任何帮助，请告诉我。我已经在这个代码库上摸索了好几年，所以我应该可以帮到你。”

在接下来的几天里，我向尼克提问了每一个我遇到的内部系统问题。

Eventually Nick started setting his chat status to "code mode" and putting on his noise cancelling headphones. He swiveled his back toward me a bit, with the body language of: "leave me alone so I can get some of my own work done, too."

This was one of my earliest lessons about team dynamics. You don't want to wear out your welcome with too many questions. You need to get better at learning things for yourself.

But this was a massive codebase, and it was largely undocumented, aside from inline comments and a pretty sparse team wiki.

Since it was a close-source codebase that only the devs around me were working in, I couldn't use Stack Overflow to figure out where particular logic was located. I just had to feel around in the dark.

I started rotating through which neighbor I'd bug about a particular question. But it felt like I was quickly ringing out any enthusiasm they may have had left for me as a teammate.

I over-corrected. I became shy about asking even simple questions. I made a rule for myself that I would try for 2 hours to get unstuck before I would ask for help.

At some point, after thrashing for several hours, I did ask for help. When my manager discovered I'd been stuck all morning, he asked, "Why didn't you ask for help earlier?"

Another struggle was with understanding the codebase itself – the "monolith" and its many microservices.

The codebase had thousands unit tests and integration tests. Whenever you wrote a new code contribution, you were also supposed to write tests. These tests helped ensure that your code did what it was supposed to – and didn't break any existing functionality.

I would frequently "break the build" by committing code that I thought was sufficiently tested – only to have my code break some other part of the app I hadn't thought about. This frustrated the entire team, who were unable to merge their own code until the root problem had been fixed.

The build would break several times a week. And I was not the only person who made these sorts of mistakes. But it **felt** like I was.

There were days where I felt like I was not cut out to be a developer. I'd say to myself: "Who am I kidding? I just wake up one day and decide I'm going to be a developer?"

I kept hearing echoes of all those things my developer friends had said to me a year earlier, when I was first starting my coding journey.

"How are you going to hang with people who grew up coding from an early age?"

"Why don't you just stick with what you're good at?"

"You're going to have to drink an entire ocean of knowledge."

I would take progressively longer breaks to get away from my computer. The office had a kitchen filled with snacks. I would find more excuses to get up to grab a snack. Anything to delay the crushing sense that I had no idea what I was doing.

The first few months were rough. During morning standup meetings, it felt like everyone was moving fast. Closing open bugs and shipping features. It felt like I had nothing to say. I was still working on the same feature as the day before.

Every day when I woke up and got ready for work, I felt dread. "This is going to be the day they fire me."

But then I'd go to work and everyone would be pretty kind, pretty patient. I would ask for help if I was really stuck. I would make **some** progress, and maybe fix a bug or two.

I was getting faster at navigating the codebase. I was getting faster at reading stack traces when my code errored out. I was shipping features at a faster clip than before.

Whenever my boss called me into his office, I would think to myself: "Oh no, I was right. I'm going to get fired today." But he would just assign me some more bugs to fix, or features to develop. Phew.

It was the most surreal thing – me terrified out of my mind that I'm about to get the axe, and him having no idea anything's wrong.

Of course, I had heard the term "imposter syndrome" before. But I didn't realize that was what I was experiencing. Surely I was just suffering from "sucks at coding" syndrome, right?

One day I was sitting next to Nick, and he was looking pretty frazzled. I offered to grab him a soda from the kitchen.

When I got back, he cracked the can open, took a sip, and leaned back in his chair, gazing at his monitor full of code. "This bug, man. Three weeks trying to fix this one bug. At this point I'm debugging it in my sleep."

"Three weeks trying to fix the same bug?" I asked. I had never heard of such a thing.

"Some bugs are tougher to crack than others. This is one of those really devious ones."

It felt like someone had slapped me across the face with a salmon. I had viewed my job as chunks of work. As though it should take half a day to fix a bug, and if it took longer than that, I was doing something wrong.

But here Nick was – with his computer science degree from University of California and his years of experience working on this same codebase – and he was stumped for three weeks on a single bug.

Maybe I had been too hard on myself. Maybe some of these bugs I'd been fixing were not necessarily "half day bugs", but were "two or three day bugs." Yes, I was inexperienced and slow. But even so, maybe I was holding myself to unrealistic standards.

After all, when we budgeted time for features, sometimes we would have "5-day features" or even "2-week features." We didn't do this for bugs, but they probably varied similarly.

I went home and read more about Imposter Syndrome. And what I read explained away a lot of my anxiety.

Over the coming months, I kept building out features for the codebase. I kept collaborating with my team. It was still hard, brain-busting work. But it was starting to get a little bit easier.

I bonded with my teammates each day at lunch over board games. One week, we had a company-wide chess tournament.

A couple rounds in, I played against the CEO.

The CEO has an unorthodox chess play style. He used a silly opening that few serious chess players would opt for. And I was able to take any early lead in the game.

But over the next few moves, he was able to slowly grind back control over the game. He eventually gained the upper hand and beat me.

When I asked him how he found time to keep his chess skills sharp while running a company, he said, "Oh, I don't. I only play once or twice a year."

He paused for a moment, his hand frozen in front of him, as if preparing to launch into a lecture. He said: "My uncle was a competitive chess player. And he just gave me a single piece of advice to follow: **every time your opponent moves, slow down and try to understand the game from their perspective – why did they make that move?**"

He bowed then excused himself to run to a meeting.

I've thought a lot about what he said over the years. And I've realized this advice doesn't just apply to chess. You can apply it to any adversarial situation.

### If You Keep Having to Do a Task, You Should Probably Automate it

Another lesson I learned about software development: since I was the most junior person on the team, I often got assigned the "grunt work" that nobody else wanted to do. One of these tasks was to be the "build nanny."

Whenever someone broke the build, I would pull down the latest version of our main branch and use `git bisect` to try and identify the commit that broke it.

I'd open up that commit, run the tests, and figure out what went wrong. Then I'd send a message to the person who broke the build, telling them what they needed to fix.

I got really fast at doing this. In a day full of confusing bug reports and ambiguous feature requests, I looked forward to the build breaking. It would give me a chance to feel useful real quick.

It wasn't long before someone on the team said, "With how often the build breaks, we should just automate this."

I didn't say anything, but I felt defensive. This was a bad idea. How could a script do as good a job at finding the guilty commit as I – a flesh and blood developer – could?

It took a few days. But sure enough, one of my teammates whipped up a script. And I didn't have to be the build nanny anymore.

It felt strange to see a message that the build failed, and then a moment later see a message saying which commit broke the build and who needed to go fix it.

I felt indignant. I didn't say anything, but in my mind I was thinking: "That's supposed to be my work. That script took my job."

But of course, I now look back at my reaction and laugh. I imagine myself, now in my 40s, still dropping everything several times each week so I could be the build nanny.

Because in practice, if a task can be automated – if you can break it down into discrete steps that a computer can reliably do for you – then you should probably automate it.

There's plenty of more interesting work you can do with your time.

![is_it_worth_the_time_2x-1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/01/is_it_worth_the_time_2x-1.png)This chart from XKCD shows can help you figure out whether a task is worth the time investment to automate.

### Lessons from the Village Elders

I learned a lot from other people on the team. I learned product design concepts from Mike. He took me running on the beach, and taught me how to run on my forefoot, where the balls of my feet hit the ground before my heels. This is a bit easier on your joints.

And I learned about agile software engineering concepts from Nick. He helped me pick out some good software development books from the library. And he even invited me over for a house-warming party, and I got to meet his kids.

After about a year of working for the company, I felt it was time to try to strike out on my own, and build some projects around online learning. I sat down with the CTO to break the news to him that I was leaving.

I said, "I'm grateful that you all hired me, even though I was clearly the weakest developer at the company."

He let out a laugh and said, "Sure, when you started, you were the worst developer on the team. I'd say you're still the worst developer on the team."

I sat there smiling awkwardly, blinking at him, not sure whether he was just angry I was leaving.

And then he said, "But that's smart. You're smart. Because **you always want to be the worst musician in the band**. You always want to be surrounded by people who are better than you. That's how you grow."

Two weeks later, I checked in my code changes for the day and handed off my open tickets. I reset my Mac to factory settings and handed it to my manager.

I shook hands with my teammates and headed out the door into the California evening air.

I hit the ground running, lining up freelance contracts to keep the lights on. And I scouted out an apartment in Oakland, just across the bridge from the beating heart of tech in South of Market San Francisco.

I was now a professional developer with a year of experience already under my belt.

I was ready to dream new dreams and make new moves.

I was off to the land of startups.

### Lessons From my First Year as a Developer

I did a lot of things right during my first year as a professional developer. I give myself a B-.

But if I had the chance to do it all again, there are some things I'd do differently.

Here are some tips. May these maximize your learning and minimize your heartache.

#### Leave Your Ego at the Door

Many people entering the software development field will start at the very bottom. One title you might have is "Junior Developer."

It can feel a bit awkward to be middle aged and have the word "junior" in your title. But with some patience and some hard work, you can move past it.

One problem I faced every day was – I had 10 years of professional experience. I was not an entry level employee. Yes, I was new to development, but I was quite experienced at teaching and even managing people. (I'd managed 30 employees at my most recent teaching job.)

And yet – in spite of all my past work experience – I was still an entry level developer. I was still a novice. A neophyte. A newbie.

As much as I wanted to scream "I used to be the boss – I don't need you to babysit me" – the truth was I did need babysitters.

What if I accidentally broke production? What if I introduced a security vulnerability into the app? What if I wiped the entire database? Or encrypted something important and lost the key?

These sorts of disasters happen all the time. And it's not just new developers who make these mistakes.

The reality is as a new developer, you are like a bull in a China shop, trying to walk carefully, but smashing everything in your path.

Don't let yourself get impatient with your teammates. Resist the temptation to talk about your advanced degrees, awards your work has won, or that time the mayor gave you the key to the city. (OK, maybe that last one never happened to me.)

Not just because it will make you hard to work with. Because it will distract you from the task at hand.

For the first few months of my developer career, I used my past accomplishments as a sort of pacifier. "Yeah I suck at coding, but I'm phenomenal at teaching English grammar. Did I mention I used to run a school?"

When your fingers are on the keyboard, and your eyes are on the code editor, you have to let that past self go. You can revel in yesterday's accomplishment tonight, after today's work is done.

But for now, you need to accept all the emotions that come with being a beginner again. You need to focus on the task at hand and get the job done.

### It's Probably Just the Imposter Syndrome Talking

Almost everyone I know has experienced Imposter Syndrome. That feeling that you do not belong. That feeling that at any moment your teammates are going to see how terrible your code is and expose you as not a "real developer."

To some extent, the feeling does not go away. It's always there in the back of your mind, ready to rear its head when you try to do something new.

"Could you help me get past this error message?" "Um... I'm not sure if I'm the best person to ask."

"Could you pair program with me on implementing this feature?" "Um... I guess if you can't find someone more qualified."

"Could you give a talk at our upcoming conference?" "Um... me?"

I've met senior engineers who still suffer from occasional imposter syndrome, more than a decade into their career.

When you feel inadequate or unprepared, it may just be imposter syndrome.

Sure – if you handed me a scalpel and said, "help me perform heart surgery" I would feel like an imposter. To some extent, feeling out of your depth is totally reasonable if you are indeed out of your depth.

The problem is that if you've been practicing software development, you may be able to do something but still inexplicably suffer from anxiety.

I am not a doctor. But my instinct is that – for most people – imposter syndrome will gradually diminish with time, as you get more practice and build more confidence.

But it can randomly pop up. I'm not afraid to admit that I sometimes feel pangs of imposter syndrome when doing a new task, or one I haven't done in a while.

The key is to just accept it: "It's probably just the imposter syndrome talking."

And to keep going.

### Find Your Tribe. But Don't Fall for Tribalism

When you get your first developer job, you'll work alongside other developers. Yipee – you found your tribe.

You'll spend a lot of time with them, and you all may start to feel like a tight unit.

But don't ignore the non-developer people around you.

In my story above, I talked about Mike, the Product Manager who also ran startup events. He was "non-technical". His knowledge of coding was limited at best. But I'd venture to say I learned as much from him as anyone else at the company.

You may work with other people from other departments – designers, product managers, project managers, IT people, QA people, marketers, even finance and accounting folks. You can learn a lot from these people, too.

Yes, you should focus on building strong connective tissue between you and the other devs on the team. But stay curious. Hang out with other people in the lunch room or at company events. You never know who's going to be the next person to help you build your skills, your network, or your reputation.

### Don't Get Too Comfortable and Specialize too Early

I often give this advice to folks who are first starting their coding journey: "learn general coding skills (JavaScript, SQL, Linux, and so on) and then specialize on the job."

The idea is, once you understand how the most common tools work, you can learn those tools' less common equivalents.

For example, once you've learned PostgreSQL, you can easily learn MySQL. Once you've learned Node.js, you can easily learn Ruby on Rails or Java Spring Boot.

But some people specialize too early at work. Their boss might ask them to "own" a certain API or feature. And if they do a good job with that, their boss may keep giving them similar projects.

You are only managing yourself, but your boss is managing many people. They may be too busy to develop a nuanced understanding of your abilities and interests. They may come to see you as "the XYZ person" and just give you tasks related to that.

But you know what you're good at, and what you're interested in. You can try and volunteer for projects outside of your comfort zone. If you can get your boss to assign these to you, you'll be able to continue to expand your skills, and potentially work with new teams.

Remember: your boss may be responsible for your performance at your job, but you are responsible for your performance across your career.

Take on projects that both fulfill your obligation to your employer, and also position you well for your long-term career goals.

## Epilogue: You Can Do This

If there's one message I want to leave you with here, it is this: **you can do this.**

You can learn these concepts.

You can learn these tools.

You can become a developer.

Then, the moment someone hands you money for you to help them code something, you will graduate to being a professional developer.

Learning to code and getting a first developer job is a daunting process. But do not be daunted.

If you stick with it, you will eventually succeed. It is just a matter of practice.

Build your projects. Show them to your friends. Build projects for your friends.

Build your network. Help the people you meet along the way. What goes around comes around. You'll get what's coming to you.

It is not too late. Life is long.

You will look back on this moment years from now and be glad you made a move.

Plan for it to take a long time. Plan for uncertainty.

But above all, keep coming back to the keyboard. Keep making it out to events. Keep sharing your wins with friends.

As Lao Tsu, the Old Master, once said:

> "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."

By finishing this book, you've already taken a step. Heck, you may have already taken many steps toward your goals.

Momentum is everything. So keep up that forward momentum you've already built up over these past few hours with this book.

Start coding your next project today.

And always remember:

You can do this.
