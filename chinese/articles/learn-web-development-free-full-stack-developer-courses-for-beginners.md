![Learn Web Development – Free Full Stack Developer Courses for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2022/01/ferenc-almasi-L8KQIPCODV8-unsplash.jpg)

The term [full stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-full-stack-developer-back-end-front-end-full-stack-engineer/) developer refers to working with both the frontend and backend components of a web application.

The frontend is what the user interacts with, while the backend is the logic for the web application.

In this article, I will cover some resources that can help you become a full stack developer:

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
- [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript)
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

I will also provide additional links to YouTube courses where you can continue to practice your skills by building more projects.

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) is a free online interactive learning platform where you can learn web development and earn certifications along the way. Each course has a series of challenges where you will learn the material followed by completing 5 certification projects.

The first four courses cover front end technologies including HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, React, and D3. The backend end development, relational database course, and quality assurance certifications cover Node, Express, SQL, testing with Chai, MongoDB and more.

Here is a list of some of the projects you will build.

- Product landing page
- Random quote machine
- 25 +5 clock
- World cup database
- Sudoku solver

After completing those certifications, you will know how to build full stack web applications. From there you can build your own projects for your portfolio and start applying for entry level jobs.

The remaining certifications cover Python and machine learning. These are more intermediate-advanced certifications and assume that you have completed the previous JavaScript certifications.

If you need help with the curriculum, reach out to the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/), where developers around the world can assist you with your code.

## The Odin Project

The Odin Project is a free online project-based platform where you can learn [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript?) or [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails?).

You will first go through the [Foundations curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) which teaches you HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, Git, the command line, and how to use a text editor. These courses have suggested readings, assignments, and projects to complete along the way.

Here is a list of some of the projects you will build in the [Foundations curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations):

- Rock Paper Scissors
- Etch-a-Sketch
- Landing page

From there you can choose between the JavaScript or Ruby on Rails curriculum.  If you need help deciding on which one to choose, please read [this guide from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/choose-your-path-forward).

The [Ruby on Rails curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails?) covers Ruby programming, intermediate to advanced HTML and CSS, the Ruby on Rails framework, and more.

Here are some of the projects that you will build in the [Ruby on Rails curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails?).

- Tic Tac Toe

Here are some of the projects that you will build in the [JavaScript curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript?):

- restaurant page
- weather app
- blog API

If you need help with the course, please reach out on [The Odin Project discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/fbFCkYabZB).

## CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This [CS50 Web programming course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript) will teach you HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Python, Django, SQL and more. You will first need to take [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).

The Introduction to Computer Science will teach you the basics of programming through a series of problem sets and a final project. Then you can move onto the Web programming course and further develop your skills.

This course is taught by David Malan and Brian Yu who are top Harvard University instructors. After you finish these courses, you will have a strong starting foundation in full stack web development.

Both of these courses are available on [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and are free to audit.

If you need help with either of the CS50 courses, please reach out on any of their [social media platforms](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/communities/).
