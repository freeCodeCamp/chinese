Hello, I’m Yuyu Liu (Miya) from the [freeCodeCamp][1] community.
freeCodeCamp.org is the world's largest open source non-profit programming education community, and it is also an open source project that has long been ranked number one on GitHub.

In this article, you will see how an ordinary person who came from a rural area, graduated from an ordinary second tier university with an uncompetitive liberal arts major, switched from a traditional industry, and has no working background in a large factory. 
You will see how I explores and discovers life meaning step by step and find out what I like and excel in in the open community. 
If you are as ordinary as me, wondering if you can do certain things, then my story should give you some encouragement.

There are too many stories to write in these six years.
I will use some keywords or questions that inspired my thinking and precipitation as titles to tell the stories that make me feel the most.
Regarding all aspects of the freeCodeCamp community, this article will not go into depth. 
Recently, some friends in the academic field are planning relevant research reports. Feel free to follow them if you are interested.


## Who Should Read This Article

If you:

-   are thinking or exploring to be a better version of yourself and bring a beautiful change to the world at the same time, or
-   want to understand the impact of open communities and open collaboration on people, or
-   like people and stories with warmth

Then why not take an hour, let’s chat :)

## Write in Front

After the successful conclusion of the [China Open Source Conference][2] (COSCon'21) a few days ago, my friends and I who organized the Chengdu event stayed up all night for an in-depth review.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-21.png)

2021 China Open Source Conference Chengdu Scene

The next day, I conducted a self-review and posted this statement in the Moments:

> Now the things I think about the most, talk about the most, and touch me the most are still the same as when I entered this field on the first day a few years ago. So I feel relieved and calm. The original intention is precious, and we encourage each other.

In fact, my original intention was simple - I hope that I can have a good influence on others, and at the same time, that I can easily be moved by those who have pure, big or small dreams and are full of energy and sparkle.

I believe that all content that can convey goodwill is worthy of recommendation, so I have talked about many stories of friends or strangers on various occasions. 
This time, taking advantage of the opportunity to solicit contributions from the "Open Source Story Collection" column of the Open Source Society, I reviewed and recorded my own story for the first time, and shared it publicly.

### About the Topic

Community (社区). Some people translate it as "community group (社群)". This word is easy to think as of "community economy (社群经济)" or something similiar. I think it is a bit utilitarian, so I never like it.
And recently, I am reading the book "The Crowd", which talks about "group psychology". I am a little bit repulsed to be included in any group, hoping to live a little more freely and smartly within the scope of my ability, with fewer labels.

Some friends also translate it as "community (共同体)" and study it in combination with anthropology, sociology, and economics. I find it is very interesting, but I haven't done so much research yet, so I don't use this word for now.

In addition, although this article is submitted to the "Open Source Storybook" column, I don't want to use the "Open Source Community (开源社区)". Because, in fact, my feelings about the term "Open Source" are not as deep as those of friends who have been exposed to it from the campus and the early days of work. 
My "community" enlightenment does not come from "open source".
Moreover, I believe that the "open source community" is included in the "open community", specifically referring to the "open community" built around software and hardware technologies.

Let us get start!

## "Are you Miya"

The first story is the prologue of all the stories, so I will look back a little far.

I come from rural area of Sichuan.
Before high school, I was a top student in my hometown. Most of my self-confidence in life was cultivated at that time.
Later, I entered the best class in the best high school in the county. For various reasons, I got worse and worse. Fortunately, I graduated before my confidence was completely worn away.

Due to age and geographical constraints, when filling up the college application, I, like many classmates, didn't know anything about what I wanted to do in the future. So the schools and majors I reported were not satisfactory.
In the first semester, in a large literature class with one or two hundred people, I wanted to show off and asked the teacher a question about the book "The Ordinary World". 
The teacher did not answer the question but changed the topic immediately and ask other students to read the articles he prepared, just like we did in high school.
After sitting down and feeling awkwardly, I was thinking this is very different from the university atmosphere I imagined. I thought teachers and students would talke and explore the truth. What could I gain from this school?

So, after the class was over, walking on the sunny street, I decided that I would skip class and study on my own.
From then on, until a few years in the traditional industry, I have been thinking and exploring what I should do, what I suitable for, and what I will be really happy about in the future.

The 6th Anniversary Celebration of Suzhou Toastmasters Club

In May 2015, I accidentally participated in an event of the Toastmasters International Speaking Association. 
It was the first time I came into the open community.
When I first met some entrepreneurs in the Internet industry, I was infected by their vitality and thought that I would be very happy if I could became one of them.

In July, I came across a special bus driver by chance.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-18.png)

The moment story I posted at that time

(Text in picture: I met a young bus driver of Suzhou Bus 178, who was discharged from the army and has been driving the bus for a year. He decorates the little area in front of him very interestingly. I asked him if I can take photos because good things should be shared~ Everyone who can be positive with their current position deserves a better future. 🌞 The most handsome bus driver in Suzhou, please spread!)

I think people like bus drivers, security guards, migrant workers, etc., may never get chance to attend events like Toastmasters, but they also have touching stories to share, and they also desire a better jobs and lifes. better jobs and lives.
I suddenly realized that I wanted to spread the good stories of ordinary people, or to create a stage for ordinary people to show.

So I ran to the bus terminal and spent an afternoon waiting for the Bus 178, found the driver, told him that I might do some activities in the future, and invited him. We exchanged WeChat IDs.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-19.png)

The bus driver who is handsome and likes to laugh

Later, my friend and I tried to build a community around "reading, speaking and making friends." We invited him to share his story. He also donated some books to the community.
Soon, he told me that he started to drive the "Suzhou Top Ten Demonstration Bus."
I told this story on the stage of Suzhou's first New Year's Eve speech party at the end of 2015: **Suzhou has more than 10,000 buses, but there are only 10 Demonstration Bus.** In the end, he switched careers to Bosch Automotive for project management.

When writing this article, I contacted him again, and he said that he is doing well now. 
I couldn’t help but cried. Haha, it has been six years, and I am still so emotional~

One night, it was quite late, and I was sitting on the bus stop waiting for the bus. A car drove past the station and stopped. The driver leaned out from the passenger's door. It was the driver!

> \-Are you Miya?

> \-Yeah, but you are not supposed to stop here, right?

> \-My shift has already ended. Do you need a ride?

> \-Sure!

I rarely tell people about this scene. Later, whenever I think of him leaning out to greet me with the simple smiles and the dialogues between us, I feel warm and moved.
As bus drivers and passengers, we wouldn't have any communication, except the eye contact while we are swiping the cards or insert the coins.
But in the community, when we remove our professional identity and just express and communicate as two people on an equal footing, we can become friends.

Just like when I invited an old friend who I had not seen for three years, Professor Sun who is in his 80s, to dinner before leaving Suzhou, where I had stayed for ten years, and returning to Chengdu, he said:

> I like the light relationship between people, just like Miya suddenly invited me to dinner. I feel very happy, this is a very sincere feeling, as precious as a pearl. It reminds us that there are good things in this world besides bad things. So I came, let it be.

**I really like this clear feeling without deliberate modification. Therefore, I understand that my state in the community is the most satisfying and happiest.**

## The Awakening of Self-awareness

My first computer lesson came from my PE teacher. I know it sounds like a joke, but it is.
In the summer after graduating from junior high school, in a small training room, facing a heavy and mysterious desktop computer, he taught me how to use Word, Excel and Baidu. He might also teach me something else, but I can't remember.
During the break between classes, I can't wait to play Mario or mushroom picking or other small games. And he was playing "Red Alert".

I have almost no memory of the computer class in high school. At that time, computer teachers often had unexpected errands, so Science teachers often came and kept an eye on us.
But I remember that I had my first QQ account in my freshman year and gradually stopped taking care of UC.

Then there is the university, which "kindly" did not assign Advanced Mathematics for liberal arts students like me. Even the computer class we learned was the simplest Visual FoxPro. After graduation, I never heared these two words again.
VFP is very easy for me, and the first experience of writing programs made me feel very fun.
I often hear science and engineering students discuss that Advanced Mathematics and C Programming Language exams are difficult. I envy them having the opportunity to study on such interesting things.

In my sophomore year, I decided to sign up for the National Computer Rank Examination: Level 2  C Language Programming.
I borrowed a textbook from the library for self-learning, which was very abstract for me, and then searched online for the previous year's test questions and the predictions of the current year's questions. I worked on the questions, compared the answers, and I felt that I can pass the exam.
Yes, I learned C language like I was learning other literature subjects.
At that time, the school conducted several training on the computer before the exam, and I only went to the training once to understand the basic procedures of the exam, since I often skipped classes.
Finally, on the day of the exam, I finished the questions very fast, ran the code and passed the test, and then submitted the code with confidence.
However, because of my absence from the pre-exam training, the way I submitted the code was wrong, and I did not get the certificate. I never attend the exam again.

In 2012, I started to use WeChat, but I was still far from the Internet.
I followed my predecessors to learn to do jobs that I think have little value and adapt to the different stuff in the workplace. 
At the same time, I was thinking about the meaning of life. I was unwilling to kill my passion in a closed circle, yet I didn’t know where I should go.
I don't even know that on the other side of the city, the Internet, entrepreneurship, technology, and so many dynamic things are happening.
At that time, they were only a half-hour drive away from me, but it was a completely different world.

However, I always have a longing for the future, even my WeChat ID is Hello MrT. T stands for tomorrow. And I am still using it today.
It referred to a song called "Tomorrow, Hello" by Milk Coffee (a pop group in China).
This song is a good representation of my state of mind in most of my youth age, and now when I hear it, I can still feel it:

> When I walk in the opposite direction / Huddled in the corner of the stairway I seek courage / Shoulders visibly shaking as I weep / I ask myself, where am I?
> 
> After every cry, I will smile running forward / Losing and finding something as I go along / To tomorrow, hello. Even in a small voice / But it jolts me awake to the meaning of courage

In 2016, the entrepreneurial partner at the time introduced freeCodeCamp to me. 
I was surprised that the community could be so energy. Thanks to the former partner.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-28.png)

FreeCodeCamp students from all over the world organize locally tech events

As a result, I spent two consecutive nights to work on problems and achieved more than 160 points. That was the first time I felt that my code might become a product.
In a phrase that we are familiar with - this opened the door to a new world for me: 
I started to understand what kind of product WeChat is, and I also started to understand other products, instead of just being a normal user;
I connected with a larger world through the Internet, and gradually got in touch with open source, education and public welfare, social innovation, social enterprise ... These terms and the people in various countries who are deeply cultivated in these fields;
I gradually understood the rules of the world, learned to accept others and myself, and saw many possibilities in my future.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-20.png)

freeCodeCamp Chinese Site: http://chinese.freecodecamp.org/

I remember that when I walked with Luoyang Hu in early 2019, I talked about a point: **In this complex and changeable world, the most rare thing for people is the awakening of self-awareness.**
At that time, I looked back and was surprised that I started to embrace the Internet gradually in 2015. Without this change, how long would I remain in the closed circle?
My awakening in the past few years has been more profound than in the past two decades!

When I graduated from junior high school and just started to use the computer, if someone told me that the machine in front of me can not only type, click the mouse, pick mushrooms, but also do much more things, and Baidu is not the entire Internet;

When I first became interested in programming in college, if there were learning resources and open source communities like freeCodeCamp;

In the first few years of my work, when I was trying to find the meaning of life, if I could understand that there are many ordinary, passionate young people in this era who are making contributions to areas that are ignored by the public. It has nothing to do with fame and wealth, they just hope to make this world a little better, and, peace of mind,

Will these awakenings come earlier?

Or, how many children and young people are like me who are eager to change but unable to start because of various constraints? What can I do for them?

> Education is a tree shaking a tree, a cloud to promote a cloud, a soul awaken another soul. - Unknown Source

I once read the sentence, "**We go to college for those who didn't go to college**", I think it's true.

Therefore, **I clarified the field that I want to shine at this stage: education for public**, and transform the knowledge and insights I have acquired over the years into educational resources, and pass them on to those in need in the community and hope to bring good changes to their lives. Persevering and clarifying the "initial intention", my life became calmer and clearer.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-22.png)

Some members of the freeCodeCamp team worked together in Hong Kong for a week in 2019, from left to right: Miya, Mrugesh, Quincy, Kris, Ahmad

Also in 2019, I officially joined the freeCodeCamp team to collaborate with contributors.
I like to introduce myself as a freeCodeCamp contributor or a freeCodeCamp Chinese community ambassador on formal occasions.
In fact, the freeCodeCamp team is a flat organization, and there is no concept of subordinates, and no one has a title.
Quincy usually introduces himself as a teacher of freeCodeCamp, and when necessary, he will say that he is the founder.
Regarding my title, I told Quincy at the time that I need a title to cooperate with others in China.
We don't like the term "person in charge (负责人)", which is a bit old-fashioned, and then he suggested to use "ambassador (大使)". I know there are also names like "ambassador" in communities such as TEDx, so I accpeted it.

## "In Shenzhen, it is really important to **find a few friends to spend the holidays together**."

In September 2021, I recorded a [video][3] to promote the China Open Source Conference, and I mentioned this story again.

Since 2016, I have often called and chatted with friends from various cities including Chengdu, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, etc. 
Most of them are programmers who want to organize freeCodeCamp offline technical events in their cities to help everyone to learn programming and also meet like-minded friends. Many times we talk for one or two hours.

I will also introduce them to know each other. 
I wrote in the 2016 community annual summary:

> In my views, these people are like pearls scattered in every corner of the world. I can feel their unique beauty.
> However, what I did not expect is that as Sister Miya, I helped to gather them, attract each other, and connect them into a string of sparkling necklaces. This is one of the few things I have done in my life that I feel is particularly valuable. 
> In 2017, I will work hard to be a better Sister Miya.

And then, I happened to see sentimental You Tiao (油条) posting an article in his circle of friends, as sensitive as me, tears instantly.
The article explained why he had to continue to lead a group of people to operate the freeCodeCamp Shenzhen Community, even when he had just dropped out of school and switched to front-end development for less than a year, the boss of the team has high hopes, and the work is super busy:

> Everyone around me, including me, is facing perhaps the most difficult stage of life:
> At the age of 20, we came to this city alone. And Shenzhen’s ridiculously high rents have caused almost everyone to stay in a room that is smaller than 10 square meters (107.64 square foot), or live in an area that is an hour away from the company.
> Life is difficult and everyone starts to do everything alone. Extroverts may be better, but introverts are always in a bad situation.
> I often say that the freeCodeCamp Shenzhen community wants to be an offline knowledge sharing platform, but it is actually inaccurate.
> **It is really important to find a few friends to spend the holidays together through the offline events.**

> Sometimes, my friends’ conversations make me feel sorry.
> I remember one night, while drunk, a friend said to me, "Did you know? I no longer have a home."
> I don't know. If he didn't mention it, I will never know it. I saw the kind of loneliness in his eyes.
> I know he needs someone to help him, but Shenzhen is so big, who cares a person who usually does not talk?
> One day, a friend from freeCodeCamp stayed after dinner and took me home. I guessed that he wanted to talk to me. We talked quite late that night.
> He talked to me about his work, his love, and his social fears. Under the dim light of my house, I could feel the deep concern in his eyes.
> That's it! If a person who is not good at expressing is not at the right time, how can he expose his thoughts to others? After a long time, he won't even know that some of his thoughts are naive.

I too understand this feeling! I once went to Suzhou to look for a job alone. Without a companion, I didn't even know where to go shopping if I wanted to buy clothes. 
At that age, "loneliness" may be our closest friend. That was the first time I knew that freeCodeCamp has such a meaning to these people. It would be great if every city had such a warm community.

You Tiao’s article reminded me: **To meet, to chat face to face, and to feel and listen attentively**.

就像最近看到罗翔老师讲述的陀思妥耶夫斯基的《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》中一个观点：

> 要爱一个具体的人，不要爱一个抽象的人。

也是从那时候起，我不再那么喜欢站在台上在聚光灯下，更喜欢在台下听别人的故事，鼓励大家去分享，为她们鼓掌。

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-27.png)

2020 年中国开源年会，我和两位志愿者小妹妹交流社区的概念

最近和一位朋友聊天，他说最有感触的是有些朋友告诉他“参加你们组织的社区活动，缓解了我的抑郁症”。

是啊，**社区对人的影响远比我们想象得大**。很开心有朋友跟我有同样的发现，并且持续通过社区传递温度和善意^\_^

在今年的开源年会第二天结束时，一个女孩跟我说：“我观察你一天了，发现你能够把‘开源’这个词用不同的人能理解的方式说出来，也就是结合她们各自的经历，让她们明白‘哦，原来这就是开源’，并且鼓励大家去分享，每个人在这里都不会感觉活动和自己无关，我喜欢你的温度。”

我说：“谢谢你这么直率地表达对我的认可。‘温度’这个词，就是我想表达的！”

其实我特别理解“感觉活动和自己无关、感觉自己格格不入”是什么样的感受。

在转行进入互联网行业前，我在一家国际项目管理公司工作，职务是项目助理，后来慢慢接触合约管理和业务拓展。我那时候工作非常努力，得到了总经理、上司、同事、客户所有人的认可。

有一次，总经理 Michael 去参加一个大型会议，特地叫我的上司 Jessie 通知我一起去，目的是让我长长见识。那天早上，我穿着唯一的一套正装，笨拙地踩着高跟鞋，跟在 Jessie 身后走进酒店里一间又大又豪华的会议室。第一次参加这么盛大的活动，我有些激动，正在想我会坐在哪里呢，Jessie 跟我说：“他们只给我们计划了两个位置，你先去旁边找个地方坐一下。”

于是，我走到会议室侧面的角落服务员休息的区域坐着，听那一两百位学术界、商业界的人们讨论我似懂非懂的议题。我根本听不进去，觉得自己精心着装，却连个位置也没有，与那些成功人士格格不入，很讽刺。很快我就脸颊滚烫，心里想着：我讨厌这里，我想出去。

感谢 Michael，他是一位很有情怀的老板。也感谢我的上司 Jessie，她总是像一个大姐姐一样照顾我。他俩似乎注意到了我的窘迫，于是 Jessie 走过来跟我说：“Miya 你去 Michael 旁边坐吧，我有事要先回公司。”

那场会议上人们讨论了什么，我完全没印象了。只记得 Michael 低下头，非常温和地跟我说了这么一段话：“其实他们讲的东西没什么价值。你现在是 nobody，没人会听你说话。但是有一天，当你成为 somebody，在上面讲话，别人就会觉得你讲的东西很重要。”

这段话给我的印象非常深刻。我当时只是点点头，暗暗地想：

> 如果有一天我真的成为 somebody，我不会在意自己坐哪里，不会在意有多少人听我讲话，我只会关注角落里有没有一个女孩，因为与人群格格不入而显得局促不安。我会走过去笑着跟她说：“请问怎么称呼你？你对大家在聊的话题有什么想法要分享吗？”

就像我后来愿意去倾听一位容易被忽略的公交车司机——**我相信，每一个普通人都有值得被倾听的故事。如果没有人给他们提供这样的舞台，那就我来提供。**

## 虚幻的泡泡

在 Quincy 的一场  [AMA][4]  里，我最喜欢他对于下面这个问题的回答。AMA，即 ask me anything，在活动中提问者可以问任何问题。

你以后会让你的小孩不去上学，而是在家里教她们吗？

> 如果家里有很多小孩，并且家长能够在家教学的话，那么家庭学校是一个不错的选择。但是，在公立学校学习对提升小孩的社交能力和情商很重要。即使公立学校有一些不足之处，但是我自己从那里学到很多。 如果我当初就读于私立学校，我可能接触不到很多社会现实。我不希望我的孩子们在虚幻的泡泡中长大。

在虚幻的泡泡中长大，这是什么意思呢？可能她的每一位同学都是家庭条件优渥的小王子或小公主，她没有机会遇到一位交不起学费、午餐时间躲在角落里吃馒头的同桌，她会以为这个世界所有人都和她一样享有便利、富足的生活资源与教育资源。可是这个世界的现实不是这样呀，当她成年之后，能够处理好现实带给她的冲击吗？

现在，试着回想一下，有没有一些瞬间，让你觉得一个虚幻泡泡被戳破了呢？

我先分享一些吧：

2018 年 12 月，在北京，Quincy 跟我说尼日利亚农村的一位小伙子因为买不起电脑而在一部老式诺基亚手机上学习编程，后来他成为了一名安卓工程师，与哈佛、MIT 的人们一起远程工作——并且这个世界上有很多人都是这样学习编程的。那时候我刚买了自己的第二台 MacBook。

2019 年 5 月，我在杭州参加  [ChangemakerXchange 亚洲峰会][5]，主办方每年会从近 1000 个申请人中选拔 20 名参加这个活动，这些参与者都是关心世界的很善良的年轻人。在一次讨论中，一个正在缅甸运营非营利组织的泰国男生问我们是怎么学习英语的。两个新加坡朋友和一个北京小姑娘说她们从小学三年级开始就有英语课了，我说我在四川，是从初一开始学的。我以为那个男生会说他是从高中或者大学开始学，然后他告诉我们他是一年前在一个难民营里面初次学习英语。

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-23.png)

2019 年 ChangemakerXchange 亚洲峰会部分参与者和深受大家喜爱的小熊

2019 年 6 月，我和团队在香港工作，每天晚上我们会在晚饭后去维多利亚港暴走，尽情感受这座城市。有一天晚上，我回到酒店，吹着空调，打开 Facebook，看到一条新闻：一对难民父女在试图游到美国的时候不幸溺亡，孩子才一岁多，她的妈妈当时就站在岸边看着这一切却毫无办法。

同样是 2019 年，我从实务学堂创始人的一篇文章里读到：根据 REAP 乡村教育行动项目的统计，贫困地区的农村学生，63% 从来没有迈进过高中的门，更不要说大学；而国统局的数据显示有近千万的 16-18 岁的孩子，已经成为了新生代农民工，构成农民工群体的 3%。我曾经是一名留守儿童，5 月我回老家看望初中时的一位老师，他跟我说快 20 年过去了，老家的小孩们依然大部分都是留守儿童。

2021 年 9 月，我坐在路边等一位老朋友来吃火锅，一位外卖小哥在我面前停下电瓶车，神情有些焦急无奈。我问他是不是赶不上送外卖了，劝他不要着急，可以和顾客打电话说明，顾客应该会理解的。他说自己送货超时，被客人退单，50 多杯奶茶，平台罚了他 500 多块钱。一向少喝饮料的我买了两杯，顺便聊聊天。小伙子今年 18 岁，刚从高中辍学，为了爱情从大连老家来到成都，这段时间找各种工作，被骗钱。现在又要找工作，又担心以后结不了婚，很焦虑。于是我给他推荐到 freeCodeCamp 学编程，加微信，把网址发给他。他说太好了，我听过编程，我想学！他要出发的时候，我跟他说你的人生才刚刚开始，安全最重要，不要学坏，好好学个技能，坚持不了可以回家去。那晚回家的路上，我想：我们不是一开始就有这么好的状态的，我 18 岁的时候，好像也是这样急着想看未来的人生是什么样。这座城市里有那么多年轻的外卖员从我们身边匆匆经过，他们有机会停下来和谁聊聊自己的焦虑吗？

在看到、听到这些事情的时候，我总是觉得难过而无奈：这个世界上有很多需要帮助的人们，我可以倾听一些人、支持一些人，可是无法帮助所有人。

在[《一诺：我们看到的，往往是片面的事实》][6]这篇文章里，[一土学校][7]创始人、曾任比尔和梅琳达·盖茨基金会北京代表处首席代表的李一诺写道：

> 我们听到的都是谁的声音？我认为是那些能发声者的声音。但是大量社会问题所冲击的，往往是那些无法发声的人。

好在，在世界各地那么多角落，我们有那么多善良的朋友愿意去倾听那些没有机会发声的人的声音，然后义无反顾投身于关心难民、农民工、孤寡老人、留守儿童…...

在讨论我的工作重心的时候，Quincy 曾经问过我一句话：你是只想帮助成都的人、四川的人，还是想帮助世界各地的人？

我很赞同 Quincy 说的：

> freeCodeCamp will help people at scale. 我们的资源有限，我们希望帮助很多人一点点，而不是帮助很少人很多。

事实上，一个真正渴望改变的人，只需要我们给她一点点帮助、指引，她就会沿着改变的路走下去，并且，有时候她还会转过身来指引别的人。

我很喜欢这篇文章[《 从客服到社会企业家丨尼日利亚女孩的自学编程之旅》][8]。主人公出生在资源匮乏的尼日利亚东部的农村，那里常年没有供电，人们也没有机会接触互联网。她的母亲很清楚一个农村女孩的唯一出路就是接受教育，所以艰辛地供她接受了高等教育。她毕业后在一家企业里做客服代表。公司改组，她面临被解雇，于是她决定学习编程。因为支付不起学费，她搜索到可以在 freeCodeCamp 免费学习。后来，她成为开发者，改善了自己的工作和生活，并且创办了一家社会企业 GreyAfricaHub，帮助其他年轻人学习编程，降低国家的失业率。

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-13.png)

GreyAfricaHub 为当地年轻人提供免费的 Web 设计培训课程

这样的学员故事，在 freeCodeCamp 社区里有很多。比如这位大学校园里的保安，[通过自学编程转行成为后端开发者][9]，给家人创造了更好的生活，并且创办了一个编程社区 Open Source Weekends 帮助更多人。

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-14.png)

马德里校园的社交媒体账号发消息祝贺这位保安成功转行

**当我们想要帮助一个庞大的社区的时候，work smart（有智慧地工作）比 work hard（努力地工作）更重要。**

有意义的事情太多了，比如写一篇文章、录制一个视频教程、在论坛回答一位学员的问题、在 GitHub 提交一个 issue 或者 pull request、和一位志愿贡献者聊天、跟合作伙伴讨论活动策划、向一位大学老师介绍我们在做什么......

如何从千丝万缕的细节中整理出事务的优先级，做当下最正确的事情？这是一位社区 leader 需要训练的能力。

**而持续做正确的事情，就会有越来越多的伙伴给我们支持，路也越来越开阔。**

特别想感谢华东师范大学王伟老师邀请我们参加[第一届“中国开源教育研讨会][10]。我们很荣幸能作为唯一来自草根社区的代表与来自全国十多所大学、科研院所以及国内外大企业的老师们交流，受益匪浅。

水歌从 2018 年起带领 freeCodeCamp 成都社区，在会议上分享开放社群如何帮助青年成长

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-25.png)

我在会议上介绍 freeCodeCamp

会议是在位于康定的四川民族学院举办的。我看到会场有很多学生，非常开心，因为总是希望自己的分享能给年轻人们一些启发。一些朋友跟我说他们喜欢我说的一句话：

> 给世界带来美好改变，不是一个人做很多，而是每个人都做一点点。

晚餐时分，华东师范大学周校长引用了我们社区水歌在演讲中的话：

> 开放社群是在家庭、学校、社会教育之外，青年人自我教育的空间。

周校长说高校应该积极配合给青年人提供这样的空间。感谢认可！

## “实务学堂就是离我们最近的开源社区”

在今年开源年会上的开放麦环节，一位分享者说听你们聊了这么多“开源”，我作为一个不是这个领域的人觉得每个人心中都有自己对“开源社区”的理解。我说对的，我正好想分享一个故事。

2019 年，[银杏基金会][11]的一位朋友 Ying 介绍我认识[实务学堂][12]创始人[欧阳艳琴][13]校长和志愿者[陈一帅][14]老师，说他们正在使用 freeCodeCamp 的编程课程。我阅读了很多关于这所面向 16-18 岁农民工子女或城市边缘青少年的公益学校的资料，关注它的动态。

学堂和 freeCodeCamp 一样致力于“推动教育公平”，老师和同学们的善良与活力深深感动着我。特别是陈一帅老师，他是北京交通大学电信学院副教授，非常有亲和力，在学堂做志愿者教编程课，和朋友们一起探索面向全人教育下资源受限的高中生的前端编程教育方案。

我后来又认识了几位来自不同大学的老师，比如华东师范大学的王伟老师和北京信息科技大学的曾铮老师。这些老师有两个共同点，一是都特别用心地帮助学生们成长，二是都很认可 freeCodeCamp 的价值。我有时候想，我是不是该像链接年轻人互相认识一样，也链接这些老师互相认识呢？

实务学堂编程课志愿者老师陈一帅和同学们

今年 10 月，我推荐实务学堂的[俊雁][15]和[艾克][16]两位同学去[学生开源年会][17]演讲。这个活动和我们组织的中国开源年会类似，不过，它是全球首个完全由学生自发组织举办的开源技术峰会，主旨是希望引导和鼓励学生了解、参与、贡献开源。

接着，在中国开源年会第一天晚上聚餐时，我和学生开源年会总召、电子科技大学学生朱芮捷聊天，他告诉我他觉得**来自实务学堂的讲者比他在大学里认识的绝大部分同学都优秀**。此前，我读过很多老师、同学、媒体、家长、用人单位对实务学堂学生的评价，却是第一次从一位他们的优秀同龄人口中听到这么高的评价！那是我在整个 COSCon 上最开心的时刻，我当时觉得非常激动，也非常惊喜，想要把实务学堂的故事分享给更多人。当然，芮捷同学善于发现周围人们的优点，并且率直地表达认同，这本身也很值得称赞。

要知道，实务学堂是专门招收在传统教育体系下被认为是“学渣”的孩子啊，而且他们中的一些人曾经是被老师放弃的、被学校开除的。**谢谢实务学堂让我们看到教育的另一种可能性。**

把芮捷的评价转达给欧阳时，她说 “Miya，谢谢你，虽然从来没有见过，我从你这里感受到太多温暖、支持”。哈哈，温暖是相互的吧。

这是两位同学的演讲内容，欢迎阅读：[《利用线上和线下的开源社区，从没有学习机会的青少年，成为编程学习者》][18]。

在会前接受采访的时候，两位同学说：

> 我觉得实务学堂就是离我们最近的一个开源社区。在学堂里，一些同学会学习编程，一些同学会学习设计，还有一些同学会学习其他的专业。在线下，同学们在一起学习，一起讨论，互相帮助。每周六，学生也会有讨论会，每个同学都会分享在这周学到了什么、遇到了什么问题、有什么感受。学堂里有一个挂牌，上面写着三个单词，<Love />、<Study />、<Together />，我觉得这就是实务学堂这个开源社区给我们带来的感受。

我喜欢和这些有些青涩的、充满好奇的、说起自己喜欢的事情时就非常能说的同学们交流。

记得在开源年会的开放麦环节，电子科技大学大一学生 Eric 龙则灵超级有激情地和大家分享他用 Rust 写的微服务框架 Hive，主持人直呼“超时了”也阻止不了他的滔滔不绝。

我的小老乡、同样也是电子科技大学大一的学生 Charles 非常大方地和大家分享自己在学校 Linux 用户组里的体验。我问他你在社团里做些什么呢，他的大眼睛扑闪扑闪，说道：“我是萌新的嘛，现在就是学习啊”，哈哈很可爱。

还有他俩的学长芮捷，和大家介绍中文学生开源年会以及 Linux 用户组帮助学生们成长的意义时，一如既往地稳，引人思考。

来自四川大学的金霄同学讲述了自己在社区中从内向变得主动分享、在协会中积极和大家协作的经历。同时，他精心准备了“猜开源 logo 游戏”，营造轻松欢快的氛围，是整个活动的亮点。

从 2015 年认识那位公交司机开始，我就常常被充满活力的年轻人们打动——永远年轻，永远热泪盈眶。

**现阶段，在“教育公益”之外，还有什么事情是我喜欢且擅长做、又有余力去做的，我想就是“青年发展”。**如前文所说，我在探索和发现生命意义的整个过程中，基本上是自己一点一点在混沌中摸索。那时候，我很希望有人可以给我一些指引。现在，也许我能给别人一些指引了。

**感谢这个好时代，青年朋友们有很多渠道和机会可以和来自社会各个领域的人们交流、互相学习。当然，加入开放社区是一个绝好的方式。**在社区里，不管你想做什么，只要你说出来，就会有人响应。

我们已经在和一些关注从小学、初中、高中到大学不同阶段的青年发展的个人或组织协作去策划一些美好行动。这一切需要长期的投入，不急，我们用很多年去做这件事。

## 我是为什么而生

最近，在和一位努力“让音乐离生活更近一点”的音乐人朋友聊天时，我说“你就是为 ‘music for good 音乐向善’这件事而生的”。

然后我就想：我是为什么而生呢？

这是本文的最后一个故事，我们终于绕到了这个终极问题。

洋洋洒洒写了几千字，到这里我就卡住了，不知道怎么写下去，于是翻书、刷知乎、思考......三个小时后，突然明白：想这个问题，就还挺耽误事儿的（微笑脸）。

我知道很多来到社区中的年轻朋友是抱着这个问题来的，那我说说现在想到的一些关键词吧。

### 从做中学

2015 年，我在一位创业者朋友的办公室看到维珍品牌的创始人说的一段话：

> If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity, but you are not sure you can do it, say yes – then learn how to do it later! —— Richard Branson

“如果有人给你提供一个很棒的机会，你不知道自己是否能胜任，那就先接受它——然后再去学如何胜任。”

我当时站在那堵墙边看了好久，后来一直把这句话放在心里，也这么去实践。这和我们 freeCodeCamp 社区倡导的学习理念——learning by doing 从做中学——类似。

**如果我们总是感到迷茫，那可能是因为我们做得还不够多。**

我喜欢自己的这张照片，它令我感觉平静，2019 年拍摄于成都，我给它取名为“芳·华”

### 接纳自己

2019 年，在五天的 ChangemakerXchange 峰会结束前的分享会上，我说：

> 我在这次活动中最大的收获是接纳自己——我不必那么优秀、不必那么不同，我没有高学历，我动手能力弱不会搭乐高，我不会跳舞，我是偏内向的不会很快和大家聊得起劲......我在工作中会和很多人聊天帮助很多人，我也会努力包容别人，表现得好像什么都能做到。感谢这次活动体验，原来“承认自己做不到”并没有那么可怕，我第一次真正接纳自己。

ChangemakerXchange 的官方介绍是“世界上首屈一指的跨越欧洲、非洲和亚洲等 80 个国家的 600 多名青年社会创业者社区平台”。在我看来，它就是帮助大家放松和疗愈的。这场活动是我参加过的最棒的活动，没有之一。

在互相交换 sugar cube 临别赠言的时候，我收到的其中两条是：

> 你是我见过的最可爱的人，你教会我做自己，在脆弱中寻找勇气。

> 你是这届峰会最出色的成员，你就像绽放了一样美丽。

**接纳自己，是人生的必修课。**

### 这个世界挺好的

2019 年，我看到[这篇文章][19]讲述了发生在美国底特律的一个故事：

在一位 86 岁的老爷爷退休的那天，在那辆他乘坐了 60 年的公交车上，司机、乘客、家人、朋友、同事们为他举办了一个温馨的惊喜“退休仪式”。有的司机，他们和爷爷早就不只是司机和乘客的关系，更成为了一生的朋友。有一个和老爷爷一起乘坐公交车十几年的男孩专门从别的城市赶回来，再和他一起最后搭乘一次 530 公交车。他们举着爷爷不同年龄段的照片上车，从 20 岁、30 岁、40 岁，一直到 86 岁……在这趟公交车上，爷爷仿佛看到自己度过的一生。

我当时在朋友圈写道：

> 越来越觉得这个世界已经很好，不需要所谓的“改变世界的人”，而且也没有人能改变世界。我们需要改变的是自己。当我们更习惯于把对他人的喜爱、感激真诚自然地表达出来，就是在向美好世界更进一步。这样的行动很简单，但是又好像很难。愿我们都温柔地对待这个世界，也被世界温柔以待。

**嗯，这个世界挺好的，我们不必忧心忡忡地要去改变什么，放松一点去体验和感受就好。**

The story is over.

所以，我不去想“为什么而生”那么深奥的问题了。以前和一位好朋友讨论说生命本没有意义，早睡早起、天气好的时候去晒晒太阳、上班路上看看花儿、有活力地度过每一天......经历、体验，这就是意义了。哦，对了，前两天我在路上看到一条胖胖的小狗欢快地跳起来，好可爱。第二天又遇到它，我就不由自主地笑了。

实务学堂的一位学生描述他的编程课志愿者陈一帅老师像是“一条活泼善良的鱼”，我很喜欢这个描述，觉得很灵动，一定是很美好的学生和很美好的老师，才能有这样的句子。我也希望自己具有那种状态。正好我的名字里有两个 yu，双鱼座，也爱吃鱼，和鱼挺有缘的;)

Do good things, and don’t ask about your future, as Steve Jobs said:

> You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

Perhaps, when we are old, looking back on our life and connecting the bits and pieces together, we can answer very well why we lived in this life.

Thanks for reading.
