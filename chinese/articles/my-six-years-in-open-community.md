Hello, I’m Yuyu Liu (Miya) from the [freeCodeCamp][1] community.
freeCodeCamp.org is the world's largest open source non-profit programming education community, and it is also an open source project that has long been ranked number one on GitHub.

In this article, you will see how an ordinary person who came from a rural area, graduated from an ordinary second tier university with an uncompetitive liberal arts major, switched from a traditional industry, and has no working background in a large factory. 
You will see how I explores and discovers life meaning step by step and find out what I like and excel in in the open community. 
If you are as ordinary as me, wondering if you can do certain things, then my story should give you some encouragement.

There are too many stories to write in these six years.
I will use some keywords or questions that inspired my thinking and precipitation as titles to tell the stories that make me feel the most.
Regarding all aspects of the freeCodeCamp community, this article will not go into depth. 
Recently, some friends in the academic field are planning relevant research reports. Feel free to follow them if you are interested.


## Who Should Read This Article

If you:

-   are thinking or exploring to be a better version of yourself and bring a beautiful change to the world at the same time, or
-   want to understand the impact of open communities and open collaboration on people, or
-   like people and stories with warmth

Then why not take an hour, let’s chat :)

## Write in Front

After the successful conclusion of the [China Open Source Conference][2] (COSCon'21) a few days ago, my friends and I who organized the Chengdu event stayed up all night for an in-depth review.

2021 China Open Source Conference Chengdu Scene

The next day, I conducted a self-review and posted this statement in the Moments:

> Now the things I think about the most, talk about the most, and touch me the most are still the same as when I entered this field on the first day a few years ago. So I feel relieved and calm. The original intention is precious, and we encourage each other.

In fact, my original intention was simple - I hope that I can have a good influence on others, and at the same time, that I can easily be moved by those who have pure, big or small dreams and are full of energy and sparkle.

I believe that all content that can convey goodwill is worthy of recommendation, so I have talked about many stories of friends or strangers on various occasions. 
This time, taking advantage of the opportunity to solicit contributions from the "Open Source Story Collection" column of the Open Source Society, I reviewed and recorded my own story for the first time, and shared it publicly.

### About the Topic

Community (社区). Some people translate it as "community group (社群)". This word is easy to think as of "community economy (社群经济)" or something similiar. I think it is a bit utilitarian, so I never like it.
And recently, I am reading the book "The Crowd", which talks about "group psychology". I am a little bit repulsed to be included in any group, hoping to live a little more freely and smartly within the scope of my ability, with fewer labels.

Some friends also translate it as "community (共同体)" and study it in combination with anthropology, sociology, and economics. I find it is very interesting, but I haven't done so much research yet, so I don't use this word for now.

In addition, although this article is submitted to the "Open Source Storybook" column, I don't want to use the "Open Source Community (开源社区)". Because, in fact, my feelings about the term "Open Source" are not as deep as those of friends who have been exposed to it from the campus and the early days of work. 
My "community" enlightenment does not come from "open source".
Moreover, I believe that the "open source community" is included in the "open community", specifically referring to the "open community" built around software and hardware technologies.

Let us get start!

## "Are you Miya"

The first story is the prologue of all the stories, so I will look back a little far.

I come from rural area of Sichuan.
Before high school, I was a top student in my hometown. Most of my self-confidence in life was cultivated at that time.
Later, I entered the best class in the best high school in the county. For various reasons, I got worse and worse. Fortunately, I graduated before my confidence was completely worn away.

Due to age and geographical constraints, when filling up the college application, I, like many classmates, didn't know anything about what I wanted to do in the future. So the schools and majors I reported were not satisfactory.
In the first semester, in a large literature class with one or two hundred people, I wanted to show off and asked the teacher a question about the book "The Ordinary World". 
The teacher did not answer the question but changed the topic immediately and ask other students to read the articles he prepared, just like we did in high school.
After sitting down and feeling awkwardly, I was thinking this is very different from the university atmosphere I imagined. I thought teachers and students would talke and explore the truth. What could I gain from this school?

So, after the class was over, walking on the sunny street, I decided that I would skip class and study on my own.
From then on, until a few years in the traditional industry, I have been thinking and exploring what I should do, what I suitable for, and what I will be really happy about in the future.

The 6th Anniversary Celebration of Suzhou Toastmasters Club

In May 2015, I accidentally participated in an event of the Toastmasters International Speaking Association. 
It was the first time I came into the open community.
When I first met some entrepreneurs in the Internet industry, I was infected by their vitality and thought that I would be very happy if I could became one of them.

In July, I came across a special bus driver by chance.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-18.png)

The moment story I posted at that time

(Text in picture: I met a young bus driver of Suzhou Bus 178, who was discharged from the army and has been driving the bus for a year. He decorates the little area in front of him very interestingly. I asked him if I can take photos because good things should be shared~ Everyone who can be positive with their current position deserves a better future. 🌞 The most handsome bus driver in Suzhou, please spread!)

I think people like bus drivers, security guards, migrant workers, etc., may never get chance to attend events like Toastmasters, but they also have touching stories to share, and they also desire a better jobs and lifes. better jobs and lives.
I suddenly realized that I wanted to spread the good stories of ordinary people, or to create a stage for ordinary people to show.

So I ran to the bus terminal and spent an afternoon waiting for the Bus 178, found the driver, told him that I might do some activities in the future, and invited him. We exchanged WeChat IDs.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-19.png)

The bus driver who is handsome and likes to laugh

Later, my friend and I tried to build a community around "reading, speaking and making friends." We invited him to share his story. He also donated some books to the community.
Soon, he told me that he started to drive the "Suzhou Top Ten Demonstration Bus."
I told this story on the stage of Suzhou's first New Year's Eve speech party at the end of 2015: **Suzhou has more than 10,000 buses, but there are only 10 Demonstration Bus.** In the end, he switched careers to Bosch Automotive for project management.

When writing this article, I contacted him again, and he said that he is doing well now. 
I couldn’t help but cried. Haha, it has been six years, and I am still so emotional~

One night, it was quite late, and I was sitting on the bus stop waiting for the bus. A car drove past the station and stopped. The driver leaned out from the passenger's door. It was the driver!

> \-Are you Miya?

> \-Yeah, but you are not supposed to stop here, right?

> \-My shift has already ended. Do you need a ride?

> \-Sure!

I rarely tell people about this scene. Later, whenever I think of him leaning out to greet me with the simple smiles and the dialogues between us, I feel warm and moved.
As bus drivers and passengers, we wouldn't have any communication, except the eye contact while we are swiping the cards or insert the coins.
But in the community, when we remove our professional identity and just express and communicate as two people on an equal footing, we can become friends.

Just like when I invited an old friend who I had not seen for three years, Professor Sun who is in his 80s, to dinner before leaving Suzhou, where I had stayed for ten years, and returning to Chengdu, he said:

> I like the light relationship between people, just like Miya suddenly invited me to dinner. I feel very happy, this is a very sincere feeling, as precious as a pearl. It reminds us that there are good things in this world besides bad things. So I came, let it be.

**I really like this clear feeling without deliberate modification. Therefore, I understand that my state in the community is the most satisfying and happiest.**

## The Awakening of Self-awareness

My first computer lesson came from my PE teacher. I know it sounds like a joke, but it is.
In the summer after graduating from junior high school, in a small training room, facing a heavy and mysterious desktop computer, he taught me how to use Word, Excel and Baidu. He might also teach me something else, but I can't remember.
During the break between classes, I can't wait to play Mario or mushroom picking or other small games. And he was playing "Red Alert".

I have almost no memory of the computer class in high school. At that time, computer teachers often had unexpected errands, so Science teachers often came and kept an eye on us.
But I remember that I had my first QQ account in my freshman year and gradually stopped taking care of UC.

Then there is the university, which "kindly" did not assign Advanced Mathematics for liberal arts students like me. Even the computer class we learned was the simplest Visual FoxPro. After graduation, I never heared these two words again.
VFP is very easy for me, and the first experience of writing programs made me feel very fun.
I often hear science and engineering students discuss that Advanced Mathematics and C Programming Language exams are difficult. I envy them having the opportunity to study on such interesting things.

In my sophomore year, I decided to sign up for the National Computer Rank Examination: Level 2  C Language Programming.
I borrowed a textbook from the library for self-learning, which was very abstract for me, and then searched online for the previous year's test questions and the predictions of the current year's questions. I worked on the questions, compared the answers, and I felt that I can pass the exam.
Yes, I learned C language like I was learning other literature subjects.
At that time, the school conducted several training on the computer before the exam, and I only went to the training once to understand the basic procedures of the exam, since I often skipped classes.
Finally, on the day of the exam, I finished the questions very fast, ran the code and passed the test, and then submitted the code with confidence.
However, because of my absence from the pre-exam training, the way I submitted the code was wrong, and I did not get the certificate. I never attend the exam again.

In 2012, I started to use WeChat, but I was still far from the Internet.
I followed my predecessors to learn to do jobs that I think have little value and adapt to the different stuff in the workplace. 
At the same time, I was thinking about the meaning of life. I was unwilling to kill my passion in a closed circle, yet I didn’t know where I should go.
I don't even know that on the other side of the city, the Internet, entrepreneurship, technology, and so many dynamic things are happening.
At that time, they were only a half-hour drive away from me, but it was a completely different world.

However, I always have a longing for the future, even my WeChat ID is Hello MrT. T stands for tomorrow. And I am still using it today.
It referred to a song called "Tomorrow, Hello" by Milk Coffee (a pop group in China).
This song is a good representation of my state of mind in most of my youth age, and now when I hear it, I can still feel it:

> When I walk in the opposite direction / Huddled in the corner of the stairway I seek courage / Shoulders visibly shaking as I weep / I ask myself, where am I?
> 
> After every cry, I will smile running forward / Losing and finding something as I go along / To tomorrow, hello. Even in a small voice / But it jolts me awake to the meaning of courage

In 2016, the entrepreneurial partner at the time introduced freeCodeCamp to me. 
I was surprised that the community could be so energy. Thanks to the former partner.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-28.png)

FreeCodeCamp students from all over the world organize locally tech events

As a result, I spent two consecutive nights to work on problems and achieved more than 160 points. That was the first time I felt that my code might become a product.
In a phrase that we are familiar with - this opened the door to a new world for me: 
I started to understand what kind of product WeChat is, and I also started to understand other products, instead of just being a normal user;
I connected with a larger world through the Internet, and gradually got in touch with open source, education and public welfare, social innovation, social enterprise ... These terms and the people in various countries who are deeply cultivated in these fields;
I gradually understood the rules of the world, learned to accept others and myself, and saw many possibilities in my future.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-20.png)

freeCodeCamp Chinese Site: http://chinese.freecodecamp.org/

I remember that when I walked with Luoyang Hu in early 2019, I talked about a point: **In this complex and changeable world, the most rare thing for people is the awakening of self-awareness.**
At that time, I looked back and was surprised that I started to embrace the Internet gradually in 2015. Without this change, how long would I remain in the closed circle?
My awakening in the past few years has been more profound than in the past two decades!

When I graduated from junior high school and just started to use the computer, if someone told me that the machine in front of me can not only type, click the mouse, pick mushrooms, but also do much more things, and Baidu is not the entire Internet;

When I first became interested in programming in college, if there were learning resources and open source communities like freeCodeCamp;

In the first few years of my work, when I was trying to find the meaning of life, if I could understand that there are many ordinary, passionate young people in this era who are making contributions to areas that are ignored by the public. It has nothing to do with fame and wealth, they just hope to make this world a little better, and, peace of mind,

Will these awakenings come earlier?

Or, how many children and young people are like me who are eager to change but unable to start because of various constraints? What can I do for them?

> Education is a tree shaking a tree, a cloud to promote a cloud, a soul awaken another soul. - Unknown Source

I once read the sentence, "**We go to college for those who didn't go to college**", I think it's true.

Therefore, **I clarified the field that I want to shine at this stage: education for public**, and transform the knowledge and insights I have acquired over the years into educational resources, and pass them on to those in need in the community and hope to bring good changes to their lives. Persevering and clarifying the "initial intention", my life became calmer and clearer.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-22.png)

Some members of the freeCodeCamp team worked together in Hong Kong for a week in 2019, from left to right: Miya, Mrugesh, Quincy, Kris, Ahmad

Also in 2019, I officially joined the freeCodeCamp team to collaborate with contributors.
I like to introduce myself as a freeCodeCamp contributor or a freeCodeCamp Chinese community ambassador on formal occasions.
In fact, the freeCodeCamp team is a flat organization, and there is no concept of subordinates, and no one has a title.
Quincy usually introduces himself as a teacher of freeCodeCamp, and when necessary, he will say that he is the founder.
Regarding my title, I told Quincy at the time that I need a title to cooperate with others in China.
We don't like the term "person in charge (负责人)", which is a bit old-fashioned, and then he suggested to use "ambassador (大使)". I know there are also names like "ambassador" in communities such as TEDx, so I accpeted it.

## "In Shenzhen, it is really important to **find a few friends to spend the holidays together**."

In September 2021, I recorded a [video][3] to promote the China Open Source Conference, and I mentioned this story again.

Since 2016, I have often called and chatted with friends from various cities including Chengdu, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, etc. 
Most of them are programmers who want to organize freeCodeCamp offline technical events in their cities to help everyone to learn programming and also meet like-minded friends. Many times we talk for one or two hours.

I will also introduce them to know each other. 
I wrote in the 2016 community annual summary:

> In my views, these people are like pearls scattered in every corner of the world. I can feel their unique beauty.
> However, what I did not expect is that as Sister Miya, I helped to gather them, attract each other, and connect them into a string of sparkling necklaces. This is one of the few things I have done in my life that I feel is particularly valuable. 
> In 2017, I will work hard to be a better Sister Miya.

And then, I happened to see sentimental You Tiao (油条) posting an article in his circle of friends, as sensitive as me, tears instantly.
The article explained why he had to continue to lead a group of people to operate the freeCodeCamp Shenzhen Community, even when he had just dropped out of school and switched to front-end development for less than a year, the boss of the team has high hopes, and the work is super busy:

> Everyone around me, including me, is facing perhaps the most difficult stage of life:
> At the age of 20, we came to this city alone. And Shenzhen’s ridiculously high rents have caused almost everyone to stay in a room that is smaller than 10 square meters (107.64 square foot), or live in an area that is an hour away from the company.
> Life is difficult and everyone starts to do everything alone. Extroverts may be better, but introverts are always in a bad situation.
> I often say that the freeCodeCamp Shenzhen community wants to be an offline knowledge sharing platform, but it is actually inaccurate.
> **It is really important to find a few friends to spend the holidays together through the offline events.**

> Sometimes, my friends’ conversations make me feel sorry.
> I remember one night, while drunk, a friend said to me, "Did you know? I no longer have a home."
> I don't know. If he didn't mention it, I will never know it. I saw the kind of loneliness in his eyes.
> I know he needs someone to help him, but Shenzhen is so big, who cares a person who usually does not talk?
> One day, a friend from freeCodeCamp stayed after dinner and took me home. I guessed that he wanted to talk to me. We talked quite late that night.
> He talked to me about his work, his love, and his social fears. Under the dim light of my house, I could feel the deep concern in his eyes.
> That's it! If a person who is not good at expressing is not at the right time, how can he expose his thoughts to others? After a long time, he won't even know that some of his thoughts are naive.

I too understand this feeling! I once went to Suzhou to look for a job alone. Without a companion, I didn't even know where to go shopping if I wanted to buy clothes. 
At that age, "loneliness" may be our closest friend. That was the first time I knew that freeCodeCamp has such a meaning to these people. It would be great if every city had such a warm community.

You Tiao’s article reminded me: **To meet, to chat face to face, and to feel and listen attentively**.

It's like the point in Fyodor Dostoevsky's "Brothers Karamazov" described by Prof. Luo Xiang (A famous Chinese jurist) recently:

> Love a specific person, not an abstract person.

Since then, I no longer like to stand on stage in the spotlight. I prefer to listen to other people’s stories off stage, encourage everyone to share and applaud for them.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-27.png)

During 2020 China Open Source Conference, I exchanged the concept of community with two volunteers

I recently chatted with a friend. The most touching thing he said was that some friends told him that "participating in the community activities organized by you relieved my depression."

Yes, **the impact of the community on people is far greater than we thought**. I am happy to have friends who have made the same discovery like me, and continue to pass on warmth and kindness through the community ^\_^

At the end of the second day of this year’s open source conference, a girl said to me: 
"I have been observing you for a day and found that you can say the word 'open source' in different ways that different people can understand. That is, you can combine with their own experience and make them understand - "Oh, it turns out that this is open source." 
You also encouraged everyone to share. Nobody will feel that the activity has nothing to do with them here. I like your temperature."

I said, "Thank you for expressing your approval for me so bluntly. The word 'temperature' is what I want to express!"

In fact, I understand what it is like to "feel that the activity has nothing to do with me and feel out of place."

Before switching to the Internet industry, I worked in an international project management company as a project assistant. 
Later, I also started to work on contract management and business development. At that time, I worked very hard and got the approval of the general manager, superiors, colleagues, and customers.

Once, the general manager Michael went to a large meeting and specifically asked my boss Jessie to inform me to go with him. 
The purpose for letting me attend the event was to let me gain insight. 
That morning, I was wearing my only formal suit, awkwardly stepping on high heels, and following Jessie into a large and luxurious meeting room in the hotel. 
It is the first time that I participated in such a grand event, and I was excited. 
I was thinking about where I would sit, when Jessie told me, "They only planned two seats for us. You should go and find somewhere else to sit."

As I result, I went to the corner of the conference room and sat in the staff resting area. I was trying to listen to those one or two hundred people in academia and business area discussing topics that I did not understand. I couldn't listen at all. I felt that even though I was well-dressed, I did not even have a seat. 
It was ironic that, even though I was well-dressed, I did not even have a seat, and I didn't fit in with those successful people. Soon, I was flushed, and I thought to myself: I hate this place, I want to leave.

Thanks to Michael, he is a very caring boss. Thanks also to my boss Jessie, she always takes care of me like a big sister.
They seemed to notice my embarrassment, so Jessie walked over to me and said, "Miya, go sit next to Michael. I have to go back to the company."

I have no impression at all what people discussed in that meeting.
But I remember that Michael lowered his head and said to me very gently: "To be honst, what they said have no value. You are nobody now, and no one will listen to you. But one day, when you become somebody, you will speak on it. Others will think what you are talking about is very important."

I was impressed by his message. I just nodded and thought secretly:

> If one day I really become somebody, I won't care where I sit or how many people listen to me. But I will pay attention to whether there is a girl in the corner, who looks embarrassed because of incompatible with the crowd. 
> I would walk over and smile and ask her: "What is your name? Do you have any thoughts on the topic everyone is talking about?"

Just like I am willing to listen to a bus driver who is easily to be ignored - **I believe that everyone has a story that is worth to be listened. If no one provides them with such a stage, I will.**

## Bubble

In Quincy's [AMA][4], I liked his answer to the following question. AMA stands for ask me anything.

How do you plan to teach/educate your kids? Did you ever consider homeschooling?

> Homeschooling is a good alternative if you have a lot of kids, and a parent at home who can teach. But socialization and building up EQ is important, and you kind of get that built in to the public school experience.

> I learned a lot from going to public school. There were short-comings. But if I had just gone to a private school, I would have been insulated from reality. I don’t want my kids to grow up in a bubble.

What does it mean to grow up in a bubble? Maybe all her friends are a little prince or princess with good family conditions. She has no chance to meet someone who can't pay the tuition and has to eat buns in the corner during lunch time. She will think everyone in this world are like her. They all enjoy convenient and abundant living resources and educational resources. But the reality of this world is not like this. When she grow up, can she handle the impact of the reality?

Now, try to think about it. Are there any moments that make you feel that an bubble has broken?

Let me share some:

In December 2018, in Beijing, Quincy told me that a young man in rural Nigeria was learning to program on an old Nokia phone because he couldn’t afford a computer.
Later, he became an Android engineer and is working remotely with people from Harvard and MIT. In fact, many people in the world learn to program like this.
At that time, I just bought my second MacBook.

In May 2019, I participated in the [ChangemakerXchange Asia Summit][5] in Hangzhou. The organizer will select 20 people from nearly 1,000 applicants to participate in this event every year. These participants are very kind young people who care about the world.

In a discussion, a guy from Thailand who is running a non-profit organization in Myanmar asked us how we learned English. Two participants from Singapore and a girl from Beijing said that they had English classes since the third grade of elementary school. I said, in Sichuan, I started to learn it in junior high school. I thought that guy would say that he started learning English in high school or university, but he told us he was learning English for the first time in a refugee camp a year ago.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-23.png)

Participants of the 2019 ChangemakerXchange Asia Summit and the beloved bear

In June 2019, my team and I were working in Hong Kong. Every night we would have a walk at Victoria Harbor after dinner and explore the city. One night, I went back to the hotel, turned on the air conditioner, open Facebook, and saw a piece of news: A refugee father and daughter drowned while trying to swim to the United States. The child was only one year old. Her mother was standing at the shore, looked at her, but could not help.

Also in 2019, I read from an article by the founder of the Kedou School :
According to the statistics of Stanford Rural Education Action Program (REAP), 63% of rural students in poverty-stricken areas of China have never entered a high school, let alone a university. 
According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, there are nearly 10 million children aged 16-18 become a new generation of migrant workers, constituting 3% of the migrant worker group.
I used to be a left-behind child. In May, I returned to my hometown to visit a teacher in junior high school. He told me that almost 20 years have passed, and most of the children in my hometown are still left-behind children.

In September 2021, I was sitting on the side of the road waiting for an old friend to have hot pot together. A takeaway courier stopped his car in front of me, looking a little worried and helpless.
I asked him if he couldn't keep up with the delivery, and advised him not to worry, he could call the customer to explain, the customer should understand.
He said that he already missed the deadline, and the customer canceled the order for more than 50 cups of milk tea. The platform punished him for more than 500 yuan.
Even though I usually did not drink milk tea, I bought two cups from him and chatted with him. 
The young man is 18 years old and just dropped out of high school. He came to Chengdu from his hometown in Dalian for love.
During the time, he was looking for various jobs and was scammed for money.
Now that he is looking for the next job, he is worried that he will not be able to get married in the future, and he is very anxious.
So I recommended him to freeCodeCamp to learn programming. I added his WeChat ID and sent him the website.
He said it was great, and he had heard of programming and wanted to learn!
When he was about to set off, I told him that his life has just begun, and safety is the most important thing. Don't learn bad things, learn a skill. If you can't persist, you can go back to your hometwon.
On the way home that night, I thought: We weren't in such a good state at the beginning. When I was 18, I seemed to be so anxious to see what my future life would be like. With so many young couriers hurried past us in this city, do they have a chance to stop and talk about their anxiety?

When I see and hear these things, I always feel sad and helpless: there are many people in this world who need help. I can listen to some people and support some of them, but I can't help everyone.

In the article [Yi Nuo: What We See Is Often a One-Sided Fact][6], Li Yinuo (李一诺), founder of [ETUSchool][7] and former chief representative of the Beijing Representative Office of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, wrote:

> Whose voice are we hearing? I think it is the voice of those who can speak. However, a large number of social problems are often impacted by those who cannot speak up.

Fortunately, in so many corners of the world, we have so many kind friends who are willing to listen to the voices of those who have no chance to speak up, and then devote themselves to caring for refugees, migrant workers, longly old people, and left-behind children...

When discussing the focus of my work, Quincy once asked me: Do you want to help only people in Chengdu, Sichuan, or people all over the world?

I agree with what Quincy said:

> freeCodeCamp will help people at scale. Our resources are limited, and we want to help many people a little bit, not a few people a lot.

In fact, a person who really desires to change, only needs a little help and guidance from us. And they will follow the path to change. Sometimes, they will also turn around to guide others.

I like this article: [How I became a programmer with the #100DaysofCode challenge][8]. The protagonist was born in a rural village in eastern Nigeria where resources are scarce, where electricity is not available all the year round, and people have no access to the Internet. Her mother knew that the only way out for a rural girl was to get an education, so she worked hard for her to receive higher education. After graduation, she worked as a customer service representative in a company. The company was reorganized and she had been fired, so she decided to learn programming. Because she could not afford the tuition, she found that she could study for free at freeCodeCamp. Later, she became a developer, improved her work and life, and founded a social enterprise, GreyAfricaHub, to help other young people learn programming and reduce the country's unemployment rate.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-13.png)

GreyAfricaHub provides free web design training courses for local young people

There are many such student stories in the freeCodeCamp community.
For example, a security guard on the university campus [switched his career to become a back-end developer through self-taught programming][9], created a better life for his family, and founded a programming community Open Source Weekends to help more people.

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/image-14.png)

The social media account of the Madrid campus sent a message to congratulate the security guard for his successful career change

**When we want to help a large community, work smart is more important than work hard.**

There are too many meaningful things to do. Writing an article, recording a video tutorial, answering a question on the forum, submitting an issue or pull request on GitHub, chatting with a volunteer contributor, discussing activities with partners, and introducing to a university teacher what we are doing...

How to sort out the priority of all affairs from the inexhaustible details and do the most correct thing at the moment? This is the ability that a community leader needs to be trained.

**And if we continue to do the right thing, more and more people will support us, and the road will become wider and wider.**

Thanks Mr. Wang Wei from East China Normal University for inviting us to participate in the [First Symposium on Open Source Education in China (SOSEC)][10]. 
We are honored to be the only representative from the grassroots community to communicate with people from more than a dozen universities, scientific research institutes, and large domestic and foreign companies across the country and benefit a lot.

I was introducing freeCodeCamp at the conference

The conference was held at the Sichuan Nationalities Institute in Kangding. I am happy to see that there are many students in the conference, because I always hope that my sharing can inspire young people. Some friends told me one thing I said that they liked most:

> Bringing a beautiful change to the world is not about one person doing a lot, but everyone doing a little bit.

At dinner, President Zhou of East China Normal University quoted the words of our community Shui Ge in his speech:

> The open community is a space for young people to educate themselves in addition to family, school, and social education.

President Zhou said that colleges and universities should cooperate to provide such space for young people. Thanks for the recognition!

## “实务学堂就是离我们最近的开源社区”

在今年开源年会上的开放麦环节，一位分享者说听你们聊了这么多“开源”，我作为一个不是这个领域的人觉得每个人心中都有自己对“开源社区”的理解。我说对的，我正好想分享一个故事。

2019 年，[银杏基金会][11]的一位朋友 Ying 介绍我认识[实务学堂][12]创始人[欧阳艳琴][13]校长和志愿者[陈一帅][14]老师，说他们正在使用 freeCodeCamp 的编程课程。我阅读了很多关于这所面向 16-18 岁农民工子女或城市边缘青少年的公益学校的资料，关注它的动态。

学堂和 freeCodeCamp 一样致力于“推动教育公平”，老师和同学们的善良与活力深深感动着我。特别是陈一帅老师，他是北京交通大学电信学院副教授，非常有亲和力，在学堂做志愿者教编程课，和朋友们一起探索面向全人教育下资源受限的高中生的前端编程教育方案。

我后来又认识了几位来自不同大学的老师，比如华东师范大学的王伟老师和北京信息科技大学的曾铮老师。这些老师有两个共同点，一是都特别用心地帮助学生们成长，二是都很认可 freeCodeCamp 的价值。我有时候想，我是不是该像链接年轻人互相认识一样，也链接这些老师互相认识呢？

实务学堂编程课志愿者老师陈一帅和同学们

今年 10 月，我推荐实务学堂的[俊雁][15]和[艾克][16]两位同学去[学生开源年会][17]演讲。这个活动和我们组织的中国开源年会类似，不过，它是全球首个完全由学生自发组织举办的开源技术峰会，主旨是希望引导和鼓励学生了解、参与、贡献开源。

接着，在中国开源年会第一天晚上聚餐时，我和学生开源年会总召、电子科技大学学生朱芮捷聊天，他告诉我他觉得**来自实务学堂的讲者比他在大学里认识的绝大部分同学都优秀**。此前，我读过很多老师、同学、媒体、家长、用人单位对实务学堂学生的评价，却是第一次从一位他们的优秀同龄人口中听到这么高的评价！那是我在整个 COSCon 上最开心的时刻，我当时觉得非常激动，也非常惊喜，想要把实务学堂的故事分享给更多人。当然，芮捷同学善于发现周围人们的优点，并且率直地表达认同，这本身也很值得称赞。

要知道，实务学堂是专门招收在传统教育体系下被认为是“学渣”的孩子啊，而且他们中的一些人曾经是被老师放弃的、被学校开除的。**谢谢实务学堂让我们看到教育的另一种可能性。**

把芮捷的评价转达给欧阳时，她说 “Miya，谢谢你，虽然从来没有见过，我从你这里感受到太多温暖、支持”。哈哈，温暖是相互的吧。

这是两位同学的演讲内容，欢迎阅读：[《利用线上和线下的开源社区，从没有学习机会的青少年，成为编程学习者》][18]。

在会前接受采访的时候，两位同学说：

> 我觉得实务学堂就是离我们最近的一个开源社区。在学堂里，一些同学会学习编程，一些同学会学习设计，还有一些同学会学习其他的专业。在线下，同学们在一起学习，一起讨论，互相帮助。每周六，学生也会有讨论会，每个同学都会分享在这周学到了什么、遇到了什么问题、有什么感受。学堂里有一个挂牌，上面写着三个单词，<Love />、<Study />、<Together />，我觉得这就是实务学堂这个开源社区给我们带来的感受。

我喜欢和这些有些青涩的、充满好奇的、说起自己喜欢的事情时就非常能说的同学们交流。

记得在开源年会的开放麦环节，电子科技大学大一学生 Eric 龙则灵超级有激情地和大家分享他用 Rust 写的微服务框架 Hive，主持人直呼“超时了”也阻止不了他的滔滔不绝。

我的小老乡、同样也是电子科技大学大一的学生 Charles 非常大方地和大家分享自己在学校 Linux 用户组里的体验。我问他你在社团里做些什么呢，他的大眼睛扑闪扑闪，说道：“我是萌新的嘛，现在就是学习啊”，哈哈很可爱。

还有他俩的学长芮捷，和大家介绍中文学生开源年会以及 Linux 用户组帮助学生们成长的意义时，一如既往地稳，引人思考。

来自四川大学的金霄同学讲述了自己在社区中从内向变得主动分享、在协会中积极和大家协作的经历。同时，他精心准备了“猜开源 logo 游戏”，营造轻松欢快的氛围，是整个活动的亮点。

从 2015 年认识那位公交司机开始，我就常常被充满活力的年轻人们打动——永远年轻，永远热泪盈眶。

**现阶段，在“教育公益”之外，还有什么事情是我喜欢且擅长做、又有余力去做的，我想就是“青年发展”。**如前文所说，我在探索和发现生命意义的整个过程中，基本上是自己一点一点在混沌中摸索。那时候，我很希望有人可以给我一些指引。现在，也许我能给别人一些指引了。

**感谢这个好时代，青年朋友们有很多渠道和机会可以和来自社会各个领域的人们交流、互相学习。当然，加入开放社区是一个绝好的方式。**在社区里，不管你想做什么，只要你说出来，就会有人响应。

我们已经在和一些关注从小学、初中、高中到大学不同阶段的青年发展的个人或组织协作去策划一些美好行动。这一切需要长期的投入，不急，我们用很多年去做这件事。

## What I Was Born For

Recently, I was chatting with a musician friend who is trying to "bring music closer to life". I said to him, "You were born for 'music for good'."

Then I thought: What I was born for?

This is the last story of this article, and we finally reach to this ultimate question.

洋洋洒洒写了几千字，到这里我就卡住了，不知道怎么写下去，于是翻书、刷知乎、思考......三个小时后，突然明白：想这个问题，就还挺耽误事儿的（微笑脸）。

我知道很多来到社区中的年轻朋友是抱着这个问题来的，那我说说现在想到的一些关键词吧。

### Learning by Doing

In 2015, in the office of an entrepreneur friend, I saw a message from the founder of Virgin:

> If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity, but you are not sure you can do it, say yes – then learn how to do it later! —— Richard Branson

I stood by that wall and watched it for a long time, and then I kept this sentence in my heart and practiced it in the same way. This is similar to the learning philosophy advocated by our freeCodeCamp community—learning by doing.

**If we always feel confused, it may be because we have not done enough.**

![](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/11/WechatIMG3515.jpeg)

I like this photo of myself. It makes me feel calm. It was taken in Chengdu in 2019 and I named it "Fang Hua (芳·华)"

### Accept Yourself

2019 年，在五天的 ChangemakerXchange 峰会结束前的分享会上，我说：

> 我在这次活动中最大的收获是接纳自己——我不必那么优秀、不必那么不同，我没有高学历，我动手能力弱不会搭乐高，我不会跳舞，我是偏内向的不会很快和大家聊得起劲......我在工作中会和很多人聊天帮助很多人，我也会努力包容别人，表现得好像什么都能做到。感谢这次活动体验，原来“承认自己做不到”并没有那么可怕，我第一次真正接纳自己。

ChangemakerXchange 的官方介绍是“世界上首屈一指的跨越欧洲、非洲和亚洲等 80 个国家的 600 多名青年社会创业者社区平台”。在我看来，它就是帮助大家放松和疗愈的。这场活动是我参加过的最棒的活动，没有之一。

在互相交换 sugar cube 临别赠言的时候，我收到的其中两条是：

> You are the cutest person I have ever seen, and you taught me to be myself and find courage in fragility.

> You are the most outstanding member of this summit, and you are as beautiful as blooming.

**Accepting yourself is a required course in life.**

### This World Is Pretty Good

2019 年，我看到[这篇文章][19]讲述了发生在美国底特律的一个故事：

在一位 86 岁的老爷爷退休的那天，在那辆他乘坐了 60 年的公交车上，司机、乘客、家人、朋友、同事们为他举办了一个温馨的惊喜“退休仪式”。有的司机，他们和爷爷早就不只是司机和乘客的关系，更成为了一生的朋友。有一个和老爷爷一起乘坐公交车十几年的男孩专门从别的城市赶回来，再和他一起最后搭乘一次 530 公交车。他们举着爷爷不同年龄段的照片上车，从 20 岁、30 岁、40 岁，一直到 86 岁……在这趟公交车上，爷爷仿佛看到自己度过的一生。

我当时在朋友圈写道：

> 越来越觉得这个世界已经很好，不需要所谓的“改变世界的人”，而且也没有人能改变世界。我们需要改变的是自己。当我们更习惯于把对他人的喜爱、感激真诚自然地表达出来，就是在向美好世界更进一步。这样的行动很简单，但是又好像很难。愿我们都温柔地对待这个世界，也被世界温柔以待。

**Well, the world is pretty good. We don't have to worry about what we are going to change, just relax and experience and feel it.**

The story is over.

所以，我不去想“为什么而生”那么深奥的问题了。以前和一位好朋友讨论说生命本没有意义，早睡早起、天气好的时候去晒晒太阳、上班路上看看花儿、有活力地度过每一天......经历、体验，这就是意义了。哦，对了，前两天我在路上看到一条胖胖的小狗欢快地跳起来，好可爱。第二天又遇到它，我就不由自主地笑了。

实务学堂的一位学生描述他的编程课志愿者陈一帅老师像是“一条活泼善良的鱼”，我很喜欢这个描述，觉得很灵动，一定是很美好的学生和很美好的老师，才能有这样的句子。我也希望自己具有那种状态。正好我的名字里有两个 yu，双鱼座，也爱吃鱼，和鱼挺有缘的;)

Do good things, and don’t ask about your future, as Steve Jobs said:

> You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

Perhaps, when we are old, looking back on our life and connecting the bits and pieces together, we can answer very well why we lived in this life.

Thanks for reading.
