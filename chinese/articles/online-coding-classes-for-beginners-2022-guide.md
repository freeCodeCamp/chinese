![Online Coding Classes – For Beginners [2022 Guide]](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2022/02/arnold-francisca-f77Bh3inUpE-unsplash.jpg)

Learning how to code can help you start a great career as a software developer. There are many free courses you can take to cultivate the skills need to become a developer.

In this article, I'm going to show you 152 beginner friendly courses where you can learn computer science and programming for free.

The freeCodeCamp courses are completely free and some of them include a free certification that you can add to your LinkedIn or résumé.

Note that some of the non-freeCodeCamp courses I've listed here (such as the university courses) are free to audit, but do require you to pay a fee if you want a certificate.

Here is the complete list of free courses, arranged by topic. Once you find a course that interests you, click that link and it will jump you down to a more detailed description of that course.
