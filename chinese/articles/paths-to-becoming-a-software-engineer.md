How to Become a Software Engineer if You Don't Have a Computer Science Degree
There isn’t just one way to become an engineer anymore. These days you can attend a bootcamp, teach yourself, get a degree, or get an internship. I attended a bootcamp but I still had to teach myself during it and just figure things out.
  假如你没有计算机学位，怎样成为一名软件工程师？ 当然不是只有这一条路可以成为工程师。当前，你可以参加编程训练营、自学、获取学位亦或得到一份实习慢慢去成为一名软件工程师。我参加了一个编程训练营，但在那段时间里我仍要额外的去学习，只为了真正能理解搞懂。

My first company hired me as an apprentice on a trial basis. After I proved myself, they hired me as a full-time engineer. I’m now a published author with one of the biggest engineering publishing companies in the world.
  我被第一个公司雇佣，在试用期做学徒。在我证明自己后，我被作为一名全职工程师被他们雇佣了。我现在在世界上最大的工程出版公司里做一名出版作者。

Meanwhile, my sister offered to work for free at a company for the first few weeks, just to prove she could do the work. This just goes to show that there are so many paths open to anyone willing to work hard and learn.
  与此同时，妹妹到了一家公司里，在刚开始的几周免费地为他们工作，仅仅只是为了证明她能做好这份工作。这就表明了，许多道路的大门都会为那些愿意努力工作和学习的人敞开。

If you didn’t get a CS degree, that’s fine! There are so many other paths to becoming a software engineer. Let's look at a few of them here.
  如果你没有获得一个计算机学位，没问题！有许多其他的道路也可以成为一名软件工程师。让我们瞧瞧它们其中的几个。

Bootcamps
A legitimate bootcamp is a great investment in your career. When I graduated from college, I felt a little lost on what I wanted to do next.
####训练营
  参加一个公认合法的训练营将是你职业生涯中的一笔巨大投资。我大学毕业时，对于接下来想要做什么感到挺迷茫的。

I’d always loved coding but had never really pursued it. My aunt knew that I was trying to figure out what I should do for my first real career steps, besides internships and part-time jobs in college, and sent me an email about coding bootcamps. This absolutely saved me.
  我一向热爱编程但却从未真正追逐过它。当我姨姨知道，我正在尝试弄清楚我应该为我真正的职业生涯的第一步做什么时，不是在大学里面的实习和兼职的那种。她给我发了一份关于编程训练营的邮件，这真的拯救了我。

I had never even heard of a coding bootcamp before. I immediately started doing a ton of research. It just seemed too good to be true. I read blog posts from every single student that had been to the bootcamp that I could find online. I read any review I could find. I started emailing students that attended the bootcamp and begging them to answer a few questions.
  我之前甚至从来没有听过编程训练营。我立刻就开始做了一大堆调查，编程训练营讲的似乎太好了以至于感觉不现实。从那些在网上能找到的、去过训练营的学生上，我阅读他们每一个人发的博客帖子。我阅读和复习我能找到的。我开始发邮件给那些参加过训练营的学生，问他们一些问题。

After I did my research, I decided to apply to Dev Bootcamp. I was so nervous when I got in. I didn’t have the money at the time so I had to take a loan from my parents. I couldn’t even find a reasonably priced apartment in San Francisco, so I was sleeping on a bunk bed with a roommate in a crowded house that had the vibe of Ron Weasley’s house but without the magic.
  在我做完我的调查后，我决定申请参加一个训练营。当我进去的时候我非常紧张，那时我并没有钱，所以我得去我父母那儿贷点儿。我甚至没办法在旧金山找到一个价格合理的公寓，在一个拥挤的房子里和室友睡在双层床里，这房子有点像罗恩·韦斯莱(哈利波特里面的主角)的味道但没有魔法。

It was the best thing I had ever done.
  这是我做过最棒的事了。

Fast forward five years and I’m a senior software engineer. I speak at conferences all the time, I’ve worked at big public companies such as Eventbrite and Pandora. I’ve been interviewed for newspapers and on television several times. I’ve been paid to consult at cutting edge companies, and I’m a published author with the biggest engineering publisher in the world. A coding bootcamp completely changed my life.
  五年后，我成为了一名高级软件工程师。我经常待在会议室里讲话，在Eventbrite和Pandra这样的巨头上市公司里工作过，被报纸和电视上采访过几次，被顶尖公司聘请去做顾问，在世界上最大的工程出版社做出版作者。一个编程训练营完全的改变了我的命运！

But it didn’t work out for everyone that attended with me. I started out with 50–60 students in my cohort. By the time we graduated, about ten graduated with us. Some had stayed behind a cohort to learn a little more. Some dropped out early, while they still got a significant refund. Others decided that engineering wasn’t for them partway through the program when the financial loss was high. Others were asked to leave because they couldn’t keep up.
  但是，不是所有和我参加了训练营的人都会这样。刚开始进去的时候我们这帮人有50-60个学生，等到毕业的时候就只有十个了。有些人要留级去学习更多，有些早早辍学了，不过他们仍然得到了一大笔退学费；当财务损失太高时，有些人在中途认为工程师不适合他们；其他人因为跟不上而被劝退。

A coding bootcamp is one of the largest purchases you’ll make in your life. Do your research. Many horror stories exist online of people who paid \$10–20k only to find out the bootcamp was a scam or the teachers were inadequate.
  一个编程训练营是你人生中最大的花销之一了。做调查，网上有许多吓人的故事：有人支付了6、7万却发现训练营是诈骗或老师不合格。

A good bootcamp will start with an online phase first, where you’ll learn from your home. It will teach you the basic concepts of programming so that when you get to the onsite portion of the program, you can focus on the tougher engineering concepts with teachers around to answer your questions.
  一个好的训练营会在线上开始第一阶段，你会在家学习，会教你基本的编程概念，所以当你到编程现场的时候，你能够专注于更难的工程概念，旁边的老师会回答你的问题。

Make sure that you find a program that also has a phase focused on interviewing prep and that supplies you with a career team. This was one of the most beneficial parts of my bootcamp. I got my first engineering job because the bootcamp helped me write out my LinkedIn and make my profile stand out. My first company actually found me on LinkedIn — I didn’t even have to apply.
  确保你找到一个程序，有一个阶段面试你的准备，并且有职业生涯团队给你提供帮助。这是我在训练营最受益的部分。我能得到第一份工程师工作是因为训练营帮我写好了LinkedIn并且让我的描述变的优秀。我的第一个公司实际上在LinkedIn上找到了我，我甚至都没有申请过这公司。

If you do decide to research coding bootcamps, I recommend you start with the following. bootcamps: HackReactor, App Academy, and Hackbright.
  如果你决定要做个编程训练营的调查，我建议你从这几个开始：HackReactor, App Academy 和 Hackbright.

Self-learning
If you have the time and can manage your own time well, this option might be a great fit. It’s definitely the toughest choice because you will need to keep to a schedule and stay motivated.
####自学
  如果你有时间并且能够很好的管理你的时间，这部分也许会非常适合你。这绝对是最难的选择，因为你要坚持一个计划并且保持动力。

It’s important to set goals to keep yourself on track. I recommend starting out with free resources before you commit to a more expensive paid course online. Try the freeCodeCamp responsive web design course to start out.
  为了让你坚持下去，设定目标非常重要。我建议你在学习一个更加昂贵的线上课程之前西先用一些免费资源作为学习的开始。试试 [https://www.freecodecamp.com]freeCodeCamp 的 responsive web design 课程来开始你的编程吧。

Once you’ve completed a few online courses, start challenging yourself. Don’t just keep following tutorials. Try to build something of your own.
  一旦你完成了这几项线上课程，开始挑战你自己。不要总是跟着教程走，尝试建立一些你自己的项目。

Pick an idea that you’re really excited about. If you’re really passionate about what you’re building, you’ll be motivated to keep going. Do you have any fun websites ideas or command line projects you could try to build? Start small but keep increasing the complexity in your projects. Later on, you can use these projects for your portfolio.
  选一个让你感到兴奋的想法。如果你真的对你所建造的东西充满激情，你就会有动力坚持下去。有什么你能尝试的、有趣的网站、想法或命令行项目吗？千里之行，始于足下，每天做一点点但是保持增加项目的复杂度。不久之后，你就能在你的简历上用上这些项目。

Make sure you carve out a dedicated time each day that you’ll teach yourself how to code. Even if it’s only a half hour every day - that will make a much bigger impact than a few hours once a week.
  确保你每一天都划分有一个专门的时间来学习编程，即使每天只有半个小时——这总比一周几个小时一次有作用的多。

If you choose to teach yourself, it won’t hurt to find an accountability partner! Try to find someone else who is on the same path as you. Reach out to them once a day and share what you did the day before to push your learning forward and what you’ll do that day.
  如果你选择了自学，这并不妨碍你去找一个灵魂搭档！试着去找一个和你在同一条道路上的人。在继续学习你今天的内容之前，向他们伸出援手并分享你今天所做的。

Apprenticeships/Internships
After I graduated from my coding bootcamp, my first job as an engineer was an apprenticeship with a ticketing startup. The startup had the resources to mentor two junior engineers and I was one of the two selected for the first iteration of the program. I had another offer from a huge tech company at the time that paid much more but I thought it was important to take a risk and prioritize learning.
####培训制/实习
  从训练营毕业后，我作为工程师的第一份工作就是接受培训，一个购票系统的建造。这个工程有着资源，要选两名初级工程师，我就是其中被选中的工程师之一。

The apprenticeship taught me more than I ever thought possible in just a few months. I paired with an engineer frequently and the company didn't put pressure on me to produce a ton of code right away.
  这培训所教的比我一个月前想到的还要多。我和一名工程师被频繁分配，公司也不压迫我立刻去写大量的代码。
  
I was so glad that I decided to take an apprenticeship that focused on learning instead of a more stressful job that wouldn't have focused on teaching me and growing my career as an individual.
  我非常高兴我决定参加了这种让我专注于学习的培训，而不是一个既不会教我东西也不会帮我在个人职业生涯中成长的苦逼工作。

The company ended my apprenticeship a month early and hired me full time as a software engineer. I was promoted to a senior software engineer a year and a half later because they had prioritized teaching me and given me individualized attention.
  公司提前一个月结束了我的培训并把我作为一名全职工程师给雇用了。一年半后，我被推去做了一名高级软件工程师，因为他们优先培训了我并且给了我特别的关注。
  
A larger company will also have a more formalized process which will mean you’ll probably have a dedicated mentor, time to onboard, and more resources. My apprenticeship at a startup was only able to hire me because several senior engineers truly wanted to help grow the career of a junior engineer and volunteered their time.
  一个更大的公司也会有更加规范的程序，这也意味着你可能有专门的指导，出国的机会和更多的资源。我的培训一开始就能接受我，那是因为几个高级工程师真的想要帮一个初级工程师成长，当然也想要他们免费干活。

However, generally the candidates for an apprenticeship or internship have either already graduated with a CS degree, attended a bootcamp, or are generally able to hit the ground running.
  然而，通常来说那些培训或者实习的候选者，他们要么就早早的拿到了计算机学位，要么就参加了一次训练营，能够快马加鞭地上手工作。

My sister taught herself how to code and then told a company she liked that she would work for free for a few weeks to prove herself. They liked her determination in reaching out and they ended up hiring her as an engineer full time even though a huge number of people had applied for the internship.
  我妹妹自学编程，然后跟一个公司说她乐意免费地工作几周去证明自己。他们喜欢她的决心，愿意让她一试，最后，即使后面还有一大堆人在申请这份实习，也先雇用她为全职工程师，。

Since these openings are still highly competitive, it’s very important to make yourself stand out when you apply. If you didn’t attend a bootcamp or have a CS degree, you’ll need to create a great portfolio and resume.
  因为刚起步的竞争极其激烈，所以当你申请工作的时候能拿出你的闪光点就非常重要。如果你没有参加训练营或者没有一个计算机学位，你就需要做一份很棒的作品集和简历。

Here's a great blog post on freeCodeCamp about building a great portfolio by Ali Spittel.
  Ali Spittel 在FreeCodeCamp上发布了一个关于建造优秀作品集的博客。
  
Transitioning to Engineering at Your Current Company
At a large public company I worked at previously, many individuals transferred to the engineering team from different teams. Some worked in customer support or in QA.
####在你当前的公司转到工程岗位。
  在我之前工作的一个大公司里面，许多人都是从不同的团队转到工程团队的，有些做客服的或质量管理的。

It wasn’t easy and they still had to teach themselves a lot, but they’re all now working full-time as engineers. They just had to prove that they could do the work and hit the ground running.
  这并不容易，他们也要去学很多东西，但他们现在都做了一名全职工程师。他们只要证明他们能够胜任这份工作并且能够立马上手就行。

This requires you to be able to get your current work done and have the ability to take on extra work in your own time. You’ll need to prove to your company that you can learn fast and you’ll provide benefit. This might mean that you need to work later and on weekends, but it’ll be worth it in the end.
  这需要你在能够完成当前工作的同时，还有时间去做额外的事。你需要向你的公司证明你能够快速学习并创造利润。这也意味着你要在周末要加班加点，但最后这都是值得的。

This benefits your company in many different ways because they get an engineer and an engineer that knows how the company works already. If you're working in QA or customer support, you know the product very well already and you know the customer pain points as well. This is a huge asset to a company.
  这在其他程度上让你的公司受益了，因为他们不仅得到了一位工程师，还是一位早就知道公司如何运作的工程师。如果你在质量管理岗位或客户岗位工作过，那你早早就了解了产品，也知道客户的痛点。这对一个公司来说是一笔巨大的资产。

One thing to note is that this won't work if your company doesn't have an engineering team. Ideally, a rather large engineering team so you can have potential mentors and engineers to pair program with when you get stuck.
  还有一件事要注意的是，如果你的公司没有工程团队，那你就没办法这样了。确实，如果有一个比较大的工程团队，当你遇到问题的时候，你就有潜在的导师和工程师一起处理程序。

Anyone Who Can Learn to Code Can Get a Job
I didn’t pursue engineering in college because I thought I wasn’t smart enough. I thought engineering was a field for men and I would be ostracized.
####哪些人可以学会编程并且得到一份工作？
  我在大学没有选择工程类专业是因为认为自己不够聪明，认为工程师是男人的领域，我会遭到排挤。

I've now worked as a senior Blockchain engineer, an iOS engineer, a senior frontend engineer, and a senior full-stack engineer. I'm a published author and I've spoken at tech conferences. I have recruiters from Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Apple reaching out constantly.
  现在我作为一名高级区块链工程师、iOS工程师、高级前端工程师、高级全栈工程师工作着。我也是一名出版作者并且在科技座谈会上演讲。有从谷歌、Facebook、LinkedIn和Apple的猎头时常向我招手。

If you can stay determined, you can get a job in engineering.
  如果你能下定决心，你就能得到一份工程师工作。
