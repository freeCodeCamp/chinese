We've been working hard on Version 7.0 of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. Here's what we're building.

Some of these improvements - including 4 new Python certifications - will go live in early 2020.

Note: if you're already going through the current version of the curriculum, keep going. As you'll see, there's no reason to stop.

### The Version 7.0 curriculum...

Will take a person with very basic computer knowledge...

Build that person up through 3,000 hours of coursework...

Ramp up their programming skills...

Solidify their software engineering fundamentals...

And they will emerge on the other side as a well-rounded developer, ready for most entry-level developer jobs.

As always, there are no electives. There is no guesswork. You can just power through the curriculum from start to finish.

And along the way, you'll learn the tools and concepts used by modern software development teams.

With Version 7.0, you'll still learn Front End Web Development skills and Back End API design.

And now you'll also learn Python and its powerful suite of Data Science and Machine Learning tools.

## Improvement #1: We're adding 4 new data-focused certifications.

In addition to the 6 certifications we've had since 2017, we're adding 4 new certifications, all using Python:

-   Scientific Computing
-   Data Analysis
-   Information Security
-   Machine Learning

You'll use libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow to build a wide variety of projects.

## Improvement #2: Instead of individual lessons, everything will be a project.

Our current curriculum has blocks of individual lessons. These can feel disconnected from one another - and even a bit like "interactive documentation."

This approach has been effective enough to help 40,000 people get their first developer job. But building projects is a lot more fun. And learning should be fun. 🙂

So with Version 7.0, we're replacing these optional lessons with our all-new Practice Projects.

For each of these Practice Projects, you'll build up a codebase - one passing test after another.

Until - hundreds of passing tests later - you have a fully functional project.

For example, instead of learning JavaScript through a series of 200 discreet lessons, you'll learn JavaScript by building a fully playable role playing game.

We will build in a lot more repetition to help you strengthen your "muscle memory" for coding.

## Improvement #3: We're adding Crash Courses on Git, Linux, and SQL.

Past versions of the freeCodeCamp curriculum taught Git, Linux, and SQL.

But we wanted to make the curriculum fully interactive. No articles. No videos. Just coding from start to finish.

So we made our curriculum run completely client-side. You could just jam through freeCodeCamp in your browser and ride a zero millisecond feedback loop.

Conventional wisdom at the time was that teaching Git, Linux, or SQL would require a file system. And this would require servers. And servers would introduce a lot of latency.

So we removed these parts from our curriculum and basically said: "go learn these from our YouTube channel or from other resources."

Well today, I'm thrilled to announce that we're working on some interactive crash courses for these three tools.

These will not be certifications. They will be stand-alone tutorials. And you'll be able to do them whenever you want. No other parts of the curriculum will depend upon these skills.

Since we're teaching these in your browser, we can only approximate a full server environment. But we're confident we can still teach you a lot of the core concepts interactively.

# Here's the full Version 7.0 curriculum. All 111 projects.

By the end of 2020, freeCodeCamp's curriculum will look something like this:

# How we're rolling everything out

We're rolling out these changes in 4 stages. None of these are breaking changes. The curriculum will remain fully backward compatible.

**If you've earned a certification in the past, you'll keep it. Nobody will have to re-do projects.**

**Stage 1**: Publish Python Certification Projects

**Stage 2**: Update Our User Interface to support New Practice Projects

**Stage 3**: Publish Python Practice Projects

**Stage 4**: Publish JavaScript Practice Projects to replace existing JavaScript lessons

# Frequently Asked Questions

## I'm in the middle of the current curriculum. Should I keep going?

Yes. Keep going. None of this will affect anything you're learning today. The new curriculum is fully backward compatible.

## I've already earned certifications with the current curriculum. What will happen to these?

Congrats on your certifications. Good news: our current 6 certifications aren't changing. They will still be in the curriculum, and each of them will keep the same 5 Certification Projects.

Remember: in order to earn a certification, all you need to do is build its 5 Certification Projects. All the lessons are optional.

So even though we're replacing these lessons with Practice Projects, you won't need to go back and do these. The Practice Projects - just like the lessons - will be completely optional.

## What are the other changes I should know about?

We are changing the name of the "Quality Assurance and Information Security" certification to just be "Quality Assurance." We're doing this because we have a new certification focused just on Information Security.

The Quality Assurance certification will cover a lot more testing. Two of its old Certification Projects are being moved to the new Information Security certification. And we're replacing those with 2 new Quality Assurance Certification Projects.

If you've already earned the old Quality Assurance certification, you won't need to build these 2 new projects. But you can build them if you want for extra practice.

## Do I need to do all 3,000 hours of coursework before I can start applying for jobs?

In practice, very few people complete the entire curriculum before going out and getting a job.

So don't think of this curriculum as "everything you should know before you start your job search."

Instead, think of this as: "everything a modern developer should know early in their career." You can keep learning new skills through the curriculum even after you've gotten your first developer job.

## Can I apply for data science jobs with this?

Data Science is a multi-disciplinary field that combines programming, statistics, and domain knowledge. It is not an entry-level field, but rather a career you transition into once you get your Ph.D. or work a variety of jobs in industry.

We teach a lot of data science tools because these are valuable for generalist developers as well. Note that we do not teach the math or industry-specific domain knowledge you'd need as a data scientist. So if your goal is to become a data scientist, you'll probably want to learn those in school or on the job.

## What exactly will be added on January 1?

On January 1, you will be able to earn each of the new 4 Python-focused certifications by building their 5 Certification Projects.

You'll be able to build these 20 projects in your browser or on your local computer.

Note that we won't add each of these new certifications' Practice Projects until early 2020. So in the meantime, you'll need to use other Python resources as a reference for building these.

Back in 2017, we used this approach of launching Certification Projects before their corresponding lessons. It worked fine, and allowed us to make these new certifications available sooner. (The new Practice Projects and user experience overhaul will take additional time.)
