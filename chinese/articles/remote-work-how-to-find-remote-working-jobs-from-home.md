## 向远程工作转变

2020年初，Covid-19大流行病让世界措手不及。

由于一切都开始关闭（shut down），很多工人被要求和鼓励在家工作，使许多公司一夜之间变成了偏远地区。

可以说，这场大流行病完全改变了工作生活。最初是一个被迫的转折，现在变成了一个新的世界和一种新的工作方式，而这种工作方式很可能会在这里停留。

人们与工作的关系已经开始改变。对固定工作场所和工人需要聚集在同一办公室内的看法，自工业革命以来一直被认为是规范的东西，已经开始改变。

随着电子通信手段，如电子邮件和聊天服务的广泛使用，以及通信平台和共享文件，许多类型的工人似乎不再迫切需要在同一建筑物内。

许多人现在也在重新考虑在固定的日子和时间打卡上班和下班的想法，并变得更加了解自己的时间和对自己最重要的事情。毕竟，有些人可能在周末更有效率，在那些日子里完成更多的工作，而不是仅仅在严格的周一到周五和朝九晚五的时间表中。

## 远程工作的利与弊

远程工作的优点和缺点是因人而异的。

但总的来说，远程工作的一些**优点**，对公司和在公司工作的人都有好处，具体如下:

- 灵活的工作时间和地点通常会提高生产力和业绩。
- 上述观点基于员工拥有更多的自主权和独立性，这反过来又导致了更快乐的员工队伍。感到被雇主信任并拥有这种自由度的员工对他们的工作更满意，对他们的时间更有效率，对完成他们的工作更有动力。
- 远程工作允许你在全球任何地方旅行和工作，成为一个数字游民，制定自己的工作时间表。具体从事技术工作时，你只需要一个良好的网络连接，一台笔记本电脑和良好的技能。
- 在远程工作中，你也会强调产生高质量的工作，在对你有用的固定时间内高度集中于任务。在朝九晚五的工作中，一天的大部分工作可能会在5点前完成，但你仍然需要留在办公室，而且在剩下的时间里，你的工作效率可能会降低。
- 办公空间是昂贵的，公司每年为每个员工支付数千美元的办公空间。远程工作将削减这些成本，节省大量的资金。
- 远程工作也意味着不再需要每天长途跋涉去办公室了。通勤往往意味着每天花大量时间堵在路上，花钱买汽油，或使用拥挤的公共交通系统。人们可以花很多时间在通勤上--通勤者每天花两个多小时去办公室和回家是很常见的。这往往是造成重大压力的一个原因。不上下班可以节省大量的时间和金钱。
- 有了远程工作，就有机会组建分布式团队，雇用来自全球各地的人员。这更能代表世界的本来面目。拥有不同观点和背景的人，每个人都有丰富的不同经验可以借鉴，反过来会创造出更好的产品和服务。
- 通过远程工作，你还可以花更多时间与你的家人和爱人在一起。
- "巨大的自由伴随着巨大的责任"，这句话在远程工作方面是正确的。通常情况下，远程工作者与公司的使命有更大的联系，这导致更大的动力和目的感。如果你与公司的价值观不一致，也不觉得工作有意义，在没有人像传统办公室工作那样盯着你的情况下，你可能很想不付出努力。

远程工作也有一些潜在的**弊端**:

- There are concerns around productivity. For example, a lack of a dedicated space and set up in your home where you can work comfortably and quietly could potentially lead to a decrease in productivity.
- A lack of a good Wifi connection, Internt speed, and decent voice quality could lead to troubles in communication. When a connection is not consistent and there are frequent disconnections, it makes communicating with team members difficult. Similarly, having poor voice quality, a microphone that doesn't work properly, or a lot of background noise can be distraction for others and make communicating over meetings harder.
- With remote work, some workers may be more prone than others to procrastination, getting easily distracted and managing their time efficiently. A good answer to that could be the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and time blocking tasks.
- Remote working may prove challenging for workers that have family members to frequently tend to and who need their attention.
- With remote work, work-life balance can be tricky at times. For this reason, some workers may enjoy the commute, the travelling to work and the removal from their home as they see it as a physical separation between work and social life. It can be a way to divide work from personal life and whatever issues are associated with that.
- Another potential issue is the difficulty in making connections and networking. This can be a challenge especially for juniors and folks that are early in their careers, and not so much for senior staff members who have developed their network over the years. Offices can be a good place for networking, but there are plenty of online communities available now, with new ones being created frequently, that can help you form connections in the industry.
- Differences in communication skills between team members can also be challenging. Communicating your thoughts in a clear and concice manner is sometimes tricky over email or a Zoom call. It can also be tough to break down problems, explain your thought process, and explain complex technical topics in simple words to technical and non-technical members of a team. And all this is necessary when working remotely. Remote work involves a lot of collaboration, so getting messages across clearly is vital, otherwise there will be frequent misunderstandings.

## How to Appeal to Remote Companies as a Developer

Not all jobs can be done remotely.

It's no surprise that tech companies are paving the way and leading this shift towards remote work.

That being said, these tech roles are highly skilled - they are what are known as "knowledge jobs".

Most companies ask for a couple of years of experience, but how do you get that experience when you have none and no one will hire you because you lack that vital experience?

It's like a chicken and egg problem, and this can be even more of a problem when applying for a remote position.

How do you showcase your skills in an affective way when you are still early on in your career?

Companies want to know that you have the skills required and that you are capable of doing the job.

Not only that, but getting a remote role involves a lot more competition. The talent pool for selecting candidates is larger than ever, compared to what it typically is for traditional office jobs.

There are many people applying from all over the world just for one single position, since there are a lot of people wanting to work remotely and have that flexible schedule.

Listed below are some of the things you can do that may help you stand out in your remote job search as an early career developer.

There is the aspect of luck that plays role in every job search, but these points can help showcase your skills to prospective employers when you don't have that much experience.

### Prep your GitHub Account for the Job

Include projects that you are proud of and are the most excited about.

Also, by showcasing projects that are related to the position you are applying to, you can discuss the different challenges you faced, the problems that arose, how you went about solving those problems and what you learned overall.

Make sure that your projects are well documented by creating [README files](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) for each one.

This way you can document your thought process and intentions while also showcasing your written communication skills which are important when working in tech.

### Contribute to Open Source

Contributing to Open Source can be intimidating as a beginner, but it is worthwhile and does make a difference when applying to jobs. It's something that many employers appreciate.

You can start off by making small contributions. For example, you can correct grammar errors and typos and create sufficient documentation for projects that lack it.

This shows that you are able to communicate well and collaborate with other developers remotely and asynchronously to solve a problem. And all that is done in public.

A good place to start contributing is by checking out the [freeCodeCamp repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues) for issues with the label "fist timers only".

Below are some resources to help you learn more about contributing to Open Source:

- [The Ultimate Guide to Open Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-ultimate-guide-to-open-source/)
- [The Definitive Guide to Contributing to Open Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-definitive-guide-to-contributing-to-open-source-900d5f9f2282/)
- [How to Contribute to Open Source Projects – A Beginner's Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-beginners-guide/)

### Create a Personal Website

A personal website is your own personal corner on the Internet and a way to show the world – including potential employers – who you are on a more personal level.

Include some information about yourself and the projects you are most proud of. Make sure all links are working and there are no typos.

The important information that employers are looking for needs to stand out clearly and easily at first sight.

Include an up to date CV/résumé and a way to contact you - preferably a professional e-mail address.

Below are some resources to help you with creating a portfolio website:

- [Create a Portfolio Website Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-portfolio-website-using-html-css-javascript-and-bootstrap/)
- [Build Your Own Developer Portfolio Website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-developer-portfolio-website/)
- [Create a Portfolio Website – A Beginner Developer's Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beginners-guide-to-creating-a-portfolio-website/)

### Learn in Public

Learning in public and getting involved with the developer community can accelarate your career and help you make valuable connections.

It's a way to showcase that you have those communication skills that employers are looking for.

Wether it be blogging, writing about your coding journey, documenting what you are currently learning, or giving a talk at a local meetup, all help create your own sort of personal brand. People get an insight into who you are on a more personal level.

Including links of all the ways in which you are learning in public and engaging with the community shows a level of dedication and that you're serious about getting into tech.

You can share your findings, explain how you solved a specific problem in a blog post, or craft lists of helpful resources to share. These activities not only help you understand everything better, but will help others that are also learning.

- [How to Become a Technical Writer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-become-a-technical-writer/)

### Gain Experience Working Remotely

Having prior experience working remotely will likely increase your chances of getting another remote job, compared to someone who doesn't have that experience and know-how.

It shows that you are productive in remote settings.

Even if you are working in a different field and are not a remote worker, but want to transition into a remote tech role, you can negotiate a hybrid role at your current company. You might be able to work remotely 1 - 2 days a week, and the rest of the week to work from the office.

### Gain Experience Working as a Developer

If you want to get a remote developer job as your first tech job, it may be more difficult than getting an traditional office job. Getting your foot in the door as a junior is hard enough, without the remote aspect.

Although this is in no way impossible to achieve, it may be more realistic to have a couple of years of experience under your belt. This can make the possibility of working remotely more likely.

It's easier for intermediate and senior level developers to land a remote role, compared to those searching for their first job in tech.

Onboarding a junior member on the team remotely and training them can prove to be challenging. This is especially true when you don't have much direct supervision and mentorship and they end up spending a lot of time alone.

Focus on learning the skills needed and building them to the point where you can market yourself well and stand out from the crowd. The more well-developed your skills are, the higher the chances.

### Show Genuine Interest in the Remote Company you're Applying to

Taking the extra time and putting in that extra effort to craft a high-quality application will help you stand out. Make sure your application is tailored towards the company you're applying to and lay out what you have to offer and why you're the right fit.

Hiring managers can tell when you've copied and pasted your application to several other positions and when it's not tailored to that individual company.

So make sure you customize your application for the position and show that you've researched the company's website and/or blog to understand what they are doing and what their mission is. This will make a better impression and make you stand out more.

## Where to Find Companies that Hire Remotely?

There are plenty of remote job boards where you can browse through hundreds of job postings and apply to any you see fit.

This section showcases some of the most popular job boards that advertise remote-friendly positions.
