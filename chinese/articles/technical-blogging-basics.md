![Technical Blogging Basics – How to Write Articles as a Developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2021/04/freeCodeCamp-Cover-3.png)

软件开发人员致力于设计、编码、测试和交付我们每天使用的软件。不管那个开发人员的专长是什么，他们对很多事情基本都了如指掌——这也就意味着他们应该分享这些知识。

作为开发者，将我们所学到的知识通过发布文章和创建视频内容的形式分享出去，是一个很棒的方法。您可以拥有自己的博客，也可以为出版物撰稿。不管是哪种，你都应该遵循特定的流程来好好写作，并引以为豪。

本文将介绍博客写作的基础知识，以帮助你撰写出色的文章，同时又不舍弃开发者的角色。

# 了解你的目的

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/intent.png)

了解你的目的

当我们开始做某事时，我们都需要一个目的，以及继续做它的动力。我们行动背后的意图和动机，因人而异。你需要找到你的意图或目的，能够解释为什么你要开始创建一个博客或分享内容。

在大多数情况下，简单的答案可能是“激情”。很有道理！它也可能是一种商业策略，或者你想教别人。也许你想持续学习——几乎任何能让你开始的东西都会奏效。

作为一个开发者，我们一直在学习新东西。记住我们所学的每一部分知识几乎是不可能的。当我们记录那些教训和信息时，这些知识也就可以被重用了。

这就是为什么写一篇关于你最近学到的东西的文章，是一个很好的主意，并且为你渐进式的文档提供了非常清晰的意图。

💡 **小提示：** 创建一个私人 GitHub 仓库，以及一个 markdown 文件。当你遇到新事物时，在这个文件中添加注释（如果需要的话还可以加代码）。

这个文件的内容将作为你今后文章的优秀资源。出于这个目的，我在维护一个名为 TIL\_2021.md 的文件（记录了我2021年学到的东西）。

当决定写博客时，我打算通过分享知识来学习。如果你想深入学习一些东西，请开始教别人。写博客就是一个很棒的方式。

# 找到你的动机

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/motivation.png)

不要放弃，保持动力

拥有动机可以创造奇迹，但是没有它就很难继续做下去。作为内容创作者，最大的动力无疑是听到读者的反馈。积极的反馈和建设性的批评总是可以帮助你改进创造的内容。

但是有个问题。刚开始，很少有人会给你反馈。如果你是一个个人博主，失望的概率会很高。因此，拥有自我激励，对维持和继续你的工作是有很帮助的。

记住——不要放弃，保持动力。作为开发人员，你有很多东西要学习、分享和撰写。

💡 **小提示：** 如果你想以开发者的身份开始写博客，开发者社区有助于你保持联系，保持动力。有很多极其精彩的社区，如 [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@atapas/joinme)，[Dev.to](https://dev.to/)，[Codenewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/)，[Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/)，[freeCodeCamp](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/)，[GirlsWhoCode](https://girlswhocode.com/)等，还有很多。

# Do Your Research

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/research.png)

Research is the key. Content rules all.

In blogging, content rules all. As developers, we may have multiple ideas, problem-solving steps, and new learnings we want to get down. But the most crucial part is being able to turn it into quality content. It's usually necessary to take the time required to research your topic thoroughly.

Let me take an example of content research here. Say you have solved a problem using `Linked List`, and it is the first time you have used one. You are so excited that want to share what you've learned. Here are a few points to consider:

-   You need to understand `Linked List` generically and beyond the context of the problem you have solved.
-   You need to understand both the pros and cons of using `Linked List`.
-   You need to set up a few examples that demonstrate how best to use it.
-   You need to make sure you explain the way you've solved the problem clearly so people can use it in their own use cases.

💡 **Tips:** Once you figure out what you need to know, you can learn about it from any well-established resource. Perform a search wionth `Google`, `Quora`, `Reddit`, and so on. `Stackoverflow` is another excellent platform to check for info on the topic as well.

Make sure you note down what you learn as you make progress. These notes will eventually turn into the article you write and publish.

# Plan the Content Structure

Plan the content structure

Once you have your content research done, the next thing is to plan the structure of the article. Excellent article content can go ignored by readers if you have an inadequate and messy content structure.

Here are a few tips to help you structure your article content in a readable way:

-   **Title:** A compelling title can help influence many readers to visit your article. No matter what, people hardly miss reading the title of the article. Keeping it catchy will increase the traffic to your content.
-   **Cover Image:** A relevant cover image makes your article very attractive. When you share your articles on social media like Twitter, Linkedin, or Reddit, a creative cover image may attract your readers.
-   **Introduction:** this section describes the content at a high level. It can be an initial paragraph or a [Tl;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read) section explaining what you plan to cover in the article.
-   **Headings and Sub Headings:** You should break the content into logical sub-topics. To do that, create sections and provide relevant headings and sub-headings. For example, I have created multiple sections with headings like `Know Your Purpose`, `Find Your Motivation`, and so on in this article.
-   **Graphics: "**A picture is worth a thousand words." This is often true, so think of supporting your content with some graphs, pictures, and so on.
-   **Summary:** A summary section at the end helps your reader recap what they have learned from the article so far. It is also helpful for a returning reader to recollect the content by going through the summary.
-   **Important Links:** You may want to end your article with a list of related links for further reading. You can use the same section to list the links to your previously published articles as well.

💡 Tips: Try to use a consistent content structure for your articles. Your readers will get used to it and find it easy to follow.

# Writing Tools

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/Tools.png)

Using tools to make you efficient and smarter

Creating quality content takes time. You can make yourself a productive and efficient content creator by using some of the tools available for free. Here are a few that you may find helpful,

⚒️ [Notion](https://www.notion.so/): this tool can help you manage your personal and professional work TODOs in an efficient manner. Anytime an article idea occurs to you or you solve an interesting problem, create a task in the tool. You can prioritize, schedule, and assign tasks with ease.

⚒️ [Grammarly](http://grammarly.com): If you are a non-native English speaker like me, there are times when you might not be familiar enough with the language's grammar rules.

In this case, a tool like `Grammarly` is a life-saver in many ways. It detects grammatical and spelling mistakes, suggests re-phrasing for complex sentences, corrects passive to active voice, and more. You can start with the free version and go for the premium based on your usage.

⚒️ [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/download): this is a free, open-source video recording and streaming tool. You may be wondering, why do I need this for blogging?

# Do Lots of Proofreading

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/reading.png)

Review, re-review, re-re-review, and so on...

When you write something, you need to check for errors and get your article reviewed before publishing or sharing it. This process of checking and making sure your content is ready to publish is called proofreading. In general, you should check for:

-   Spelling errors
-   Grammatical mistakes
-   Formatting issues
-   Punctuation
-   Accuracy
-   Language Consistency

When it comes to proofreading and reviewing, here is a famous quote for some inspiration:

> “I've found the best way to revise your own work is to pretend that somebody else wrote it and then to rip the living sh\*t out of it.” ― Don Roff

# Publish Your Article

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/publish.png)

Don't keep it to yourself, just publish it

If you are happy with the article after your proofreading, the next logical step is to publish it. You may want to schedule it to publish on a particular day of the week, or you may want to publish right then – it is up to you.

As a general principle, it is better to publish when an article is ready from your side. Similarly, you should never rush to publish an article to meet a deadline.

💡 **Tips:** Publishing your article should be part of the entire plan. If you have to publish an article by a specific date, work backward to plan the content accordingly. Do not compromise the quality of the content in the rush of publishing it.

# Share Your Article on Social Media

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/04/socialize.png)

Social media platforms are a big booster

Social media is an extremely powerful tool. And you should make positive use of it as a blogger.

Publishing your article may not be enough if you want it to reach as many potential readers as it can. It's therefore a good idea to share your article on various social media platforms.

Here a few platforms where you should share your article links:

-   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/)
-   [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)
-   [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
-   [FaceBook](https://facebook.com/)

There are a few more platforms where link sharing alone may not work very well. You can create a cover image/graphic suitable to the topic and upload the image (and share the link) to places like [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) and [Pinterest](https://in.pinterest.com/) using the right hashtags.

💡 Tips: Make sure you follow the policies and guidelines specified by each social media platform when you share your blog link. If you don't, your account could be flagged or banned.

Another exciting way to share your content is by republishing it. You can republish your article on another blogging platform if you are allowed to do so. For example, an article written on the `Hashnode` platform can be republished on the `Dev.to` platform and vice-versa.

💡 **Tips:** You can set the `Canonical URL` to the link of the original article when you republish it. This is a way to tell the search engines like Google which is the original copy of the content and eliminate duplicate content.
