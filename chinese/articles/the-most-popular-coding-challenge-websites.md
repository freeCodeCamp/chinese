# Best Coding Challenge Websites

## 1\. [beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/login) (Formerly URI)

![beecrowd banner](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/zwnoz97xawck4unafkbz.png)

beecrowd 非常适合那些刚刚开始的适合初学者，来解决编码难题的网站。它曾经被命名为**URI**，所以有可能你已经熟悉这个网站的 URI 了。

如果你想解决特定类别的问题，那么你很幸运，因为这个网站也提供这个服务。

![chodi765ql8li7b9yia6](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/chodi765ql8li7b9yia6.png)

下面是一个**字符串**问题集的图片。你还可以通过 ID（#）、名称（NAME）、主题（SUBJECT）、已解决（SOLVED）等过滤问题。初学者非常喜欢这些功能。

![2afljp6rrtm1c4co62vr](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/2afljp6rrtm1c4co62vr.png)

在这个网站上，你还可以参加不同的编程比赛，并查看你的全球排名、全国排名和全校排名。

另外，你还可以查看你的进度，注册后过了多少天，你解决了多少问题，你得到了多少分数，等等。

你还会得到一个漂亮的个人资料页面，看起来也很美。😊我在刚刚开始 CP（竞争性编程）之旅的时候，曾经在这个网站上练习解题。更不用说，在我的大学里，我在 1250 名学生中获得了第三名的成绩。🎉

你也可以看看我的 [beecrowd profile here](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/profile/436965).

## 2\. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

![wla1ho0uoz9xuvp5iuwi](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/wla1ho0uoz9xuvp5iuwi.png)

HackerRank 是目前最受欢迎的编码练习网站之一。这对每个人来说都是一个不错的平台，尤其是初学者。

该网站看起来很漂亮而且很精致，第一次来这里的用户在浏览整个网站时不会感到费力，所以这绝对是一件好事。

![Login page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/wr0o61pq2ngfwil3ys9d.png)

HackerRank 为公司和开发人员提供不同的入口。如果你是为了解决问题而学习，那么你会选择 **For Developers** 部分。

如果你想学习任何特定的主题或编程语言，那么这个网站是你开始学习的最佳场所。你可以按主题进行准备。你还可以参加他们的认证考试，在人群中脱颖而出。我已经通过了他们的 Python（基础）认证考试

![Prep](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/k3j4sfp9tovx9ifphf0a.png)

你也可以从那里选择准备工具包，如果你愿意，可以在面试前做好准备。 此外，您还可以参加编程竞赛。

在这里，你还会得到一个漂亮的个人简介页面。你可以从 HackerRank [这里](https://www.hackerrank.com/FahimFBA)查看我的简介。

![My HackerRank profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/sfp2rcqtx9b4fs8wv3m8.png)

## 3\. [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)

![Codeforces Banner](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/8wtc4xnpohe9yr6j2eij.png)

Codeforces 是世界上最常用和最知名的编码挑战和练习网站之一，它由 Telegram 赞助。特别是如果你知道 CP（竞争性编程），那么你很有可能听说过很多关于这个网站的事情。

虽然对于新人来说，这个网站可能看起来有点不同，但你不需要太多的时间来适应它。你可以通过解决不同类别、不同难度的问题来训练自己。

有竞争力的程序员根据他们在编程比赛中的成功结果有等级。如果你听说过**红色**程序员/**紫色**程序员等，那么肯定是来自 Codeforces。

![Codeforces Ranking System](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/17fansawmwowcvhyc639.png)

你可以从上面的图片中了解到 Codeforces 的排名系统。更多细节，您可以查看[本博客文章](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/68288)。

Codeforces 每周定期安排比赛，它们被分为第一组、第二组、第三组和第四组。他们还安排全球回合和教育回合竞赛。你可以直接从[这里](https://codeforces.com/contests)获得竞赛的时间轴。

Codeforces 还在其网站上提供了一个很好的用户资料。你也可以查看[我的](https://codeforces.com/profile/FahimFBA)。

## 4\. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

![Leetcode banner](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/jk9l09bi3ku5d0op2x7j.png)

如果你熟悉**FAANG**（Facebook、Apple、Amazon、Netflix、Google）的流行语，那么你肯定应该知道这个网站 如果你想为 FAANG 等大型巨型科技公司的编码面试做练习，那么他们都会做**leetcoding**。

你可能认为我在上面这段话中打错了字。不，我没有。LeetCode 在那些以 FAANG 为目标的人和那些正在努力提高解决问题的能力的人中已经变得如此受欢迎。参加 LeetCode 上的竞赛已经很普遍，人们称之为 leetcoding!

在这里，你可以解决很多问题，并通过列表、难度等级、状态和标签来筛选问题。

![LeetCode ProblemSet1](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/tphf8k817fbz0vsge9d3.png)

你还可以选择有关数组、字符串、哈希表、动态规划编程和其他许多类别的问题。

![LeetCode ProblemSet2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/0y0ov1fxzvxwiv5bglri.png)

正如我上面提到的，你也可以参加编程比赛。唯一使 LeetCode 不同的是，它是基于算法练习的。是的，LeetCode 和其他编码网站不一样，因为它只关注算法练习。

在这里，你不需要提供解决问题的完整代码，你只需要用任何流行的语言提供一个有效的算法来解决这个问题就可以了。

你还可以看到你的代码在其他人中的表现，其实现的算法需要多少空间和时间，等等。

最重要的是，LeetCode 有一个惊人的讨论组，人们在那里谈论他们的问题、解决方案、如何改进他们的算法、如何提高他们代码的效率等等。这是 LeetCode 最强大的功能之一。

LeetCode 的一个悲哀之处在于，你不会免费获得每一个功能！这一点是真的。是的，这是真的。你必须按月或按年付费才能解锁它的所有功能。有很多问题你会发现在网站上被锁定。如果你不购买高级计划，你就不能解锁它们。

![LeetCode pricing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/tvww5ogj3eq5qw23ss8m.png)

如果你刚刚开始你在 LeetCode 上的算法之旅，那么实际上你不需要担心他们的高级计划，因为免费版本对你来说已经足够了。

后来，如果你想变得更加认真，那么支付他们的高级订阅费用将是一个大问题，因为你将获得大量的更多的功能。这非常有帮助，包括像顶级面试问题、顶级 FAANG 问题、视频解释等等。

你还可以在 LeetCode 上得到一个漂亮的个人资料页。你可以看看[我的](https://leetcode.com/FBA/).

![My LeetCode profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/7rv0yyw75le21sndymru.png)

## 5\. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

![Kaggle banner](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/28oqgu17gaiczlsv0k2t.png)

I was pretty confused before writing this section, as Kaggle is not a typical website for coding practice. This website is basically for Data Science, and it's one of the most popular websites out there for this.

> Kaggle is an online community platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts.

> It is a popular crowd-sourced platform to attract, nurture, train, and challenge Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiasts from all around the world to come together and solve numerous Data Science, Predictive Analytics, and Machine Learning problems.

So if you are interested in Data Science, then you should check this website. Here you can check others' notebooks, submit your notebook, join in the contests, improve datasets, and so on.

> Kaggle allows users to collaborate with other users, find and publish datasets, use GPU integrated notebooks, and compete with other data scientists to solve data science challenges.

Also, if you are interested in data science, but don't know where to start, then don't worry! Kaggle has got you covered. You can check their [learning section](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) where they have many free courses which will teach you a lot of stuff from the beginning.

![kaggle free courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/b2jgodslps0qrx6txu59.png)

✨ BONUS: If you want to learn more then I'd suggest that you complete the [data science playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAblQe2CCWqV4Zy3LY01Z8aF1) from freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.

![fcc courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/voyp7nxuepo7azxw6syk.png)

Kaggle also provides rankings and a nice user profile. You can check out my profile [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mdfahimbinamin).

![FBA kaggle](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/lqcwsixdumi4bxc670s9.png)

## 6\. [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)

![CodeChef banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/8ma2hdum4nd1eo8zmjek.png)

CodeChef is another popular Indian website like [HackerRank](#2hackerrank) where you can solve a lot of problems, take part in contests, and so on.

You can filter the problems based on different categories and solve them using any of the most popular programming languages.

They also have a learning section on their website where you can learn how to solve problems in a systematic way. This is super helpful, especially for beginners.

In their learning section, you can choose self-learning, mentored learning, and doubt support. Some of them are free of charge, but in some courses, you have to pay before you can start them.

![mentor price](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/qyfzttpt7eq78zdqkdt9.png)

This website also provides user ranking including the global ranking and country-wide ranking. They also provide a user profile on their website. You can check out mine [here](https://www.codechef.com/users/fahimfba) although I am not active on most of the websites right now. 😅

![codechef fba](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/vhq0agb1ijtdbsj3s7gu.png)

## 7\. [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)

![AtCoder banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/rqsw6hjecf5fqpqoxowp.png)

> AtCoder is a programming contest website based in Japan. Makoto Soejima (rng\_58) who is one of the former admins and problem writers from Topcoder is a founding member of AtCoder.

On this website, you can take part in different programming contests. They held regular programming contests on Saturdays and Sundays. Also, you can solve problems from previously held programming contests.

I have seen a lot of people regularly participate in the programming contests and solve problems previously used in the contests regularly by solving problems on AtCoder. I also tried that for a while to check the efficiency, and truth to be told, it was really effective.

Here you can also check the global ranking. Here you will also get your own profile page where you and others can see your global ranking and so on.

## 8\. [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/)

![Topcoder banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/89rcnewgpzfxbsb37inz.png)

> Topcoder (formerly TopCoder) is a crowdsourcing company with an open global community of designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers. Topcoder pays community members for their work on the projects and sells community services to corporate, mid-size, and small-business clients.

Here you can earn, learn, and do a lot more in their MVP program. For earning, you can participate in five different tracks, become a copilot, become a reviewer, and also get a freelance contract gig through [Topcoder Gig Work](https://www.topcoder.com/community/member-programs/gigs).

Personally, I feel this website is a little bit overwhelming for beginners. You can get more details in the YouTube videos I have made for you.

## 9\. [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/)

![Coderbyte banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/5vm2yrbrsuhfi6lvsc1c.png)

Coderbyte has a huge collection of problems that you can solve. They also offer a challenging library, starter courses, interview kits, career resources and so on.

To get all the features, you need to buy a subscription plan from them. I personally liked their interview kit a lot.

![Interview kits](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/qnrvl8ja8rqwb6zun4e0.png)

Here you will also get a personal profile page.

## 10\. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

![Project Euler banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/howuvtc16ehu8lqbw520.png)

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.

Project Euler is a great website for solving mathematical challenging problems. But solving a problem on this website requires more than just simple mathematical knowledge.

If you want to solve mathematical problems in a more analytical way, then this website will come in handy.

![Problem set](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/94mguaui3nj6s7pcw942.png)

## 11\. [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

![Codewars banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/ygf3uzjmuiycbu34fv5l.png)

Codewars is a coding challenge website for people of all programming levels. It claims to have a community of over 3 million developers.

One of the biggest benefits of this website is that it is highly focused on algorithms like LeetCode. Moreover, if your goal is to get very good at writing clean and efficient programs, then this website can be a great asset to you.

In Codewars, you will see **Kata** and **Kyu** a lot.

> Kyu (or Kyū) indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan). This is why they count downward. Once you reach master level, we count upward. Black belts in martial arts are Dan level.

> On Codewars, kata are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Others are puzzles meant to test your creative problem solving, while others are based on real world coding scenarios.

If you want to know more about how the ranking system works on Codewars, then simply check their docs [here](https://docs.codewars.com/gamification/ranks/).

On Codewars you will also get a nice profile page like [mine](https://www.codewars.com/users/FBA). Keep in mind that I haven't solved that much on this website; therefore my profile page would seem empty. 😅

Additionally, I find their [leaderboard page](https://www.codewars.com/users/leaderboard) quite amusing.

## 12\. [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/)

![SPOJ banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/4awf6fpql913onx0111u.png)

SPOJ is a website that contains huge problems for solving. It claims to have 315,000 registered users and over 20,000 problems.

According to GFG,

> You can start solving problems with maximum submission and follow or check the submission of good coders here. Once you solved around 50-70 problems and build some confidence, you can participate in different contests.

Their problem set is also quite amusing.

![SPOJ problem set](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/tm5g46f3qie8kr9aizwk.png)

You will also get a nice user profile page here which you can use to showcase your problem solve skills.

In CodinGame, you can improve your coding skills with fun exercises in more than 25 programming languages.

It is a good website for intermediate and advanced software engineers to have fun while continuing to keep their skills sharp. Also, the challenges are gamified and the multiplayer access means that users can challenge friends and coworkers.

## 14\. [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) (Popularly known as GFG)

![GeeksforGeeks banner Image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/wo3e2tzi15abavql5c9w.png)

You might wonder why I am including GFG in this article as it only provides algorithms, tutorials, and so on.

Well, that's not all they offer. Yes, GFG is pretty popular for its tutorials, algorithms, and so on, but they also provide a nice problem-solving platform [here](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/).

![practice GFG](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/m8g6z50xvemt64t4pwvw.png)

You can also filter the problems as you see fit for yourself.

![GFG filter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/iyajkn39wvqiqzpk52ba.png)

You will also get your profile page where you can show your progress in problem solving on the GFG website.

- Parsing/Grammar
- Recursion/Branch and Bound
- String

They also provide you with a nice profile page where you can see your activities. It might seem odd, but sometimes I find this website better than LeetCode in some cases. Moreover, everything you do on this website is completely free of cost!

## 17\. [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)

![Exercism banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/mik6ovwsb4vsej25gtfg.png)

You can develop your programming fluency in 57 different programming languages with their unique blend of learning, practice and mentoring.

Exercism is completely free of cost, and it's built by people like us. You can also contribute or donate to them to support their amazing service for free.

They also provide a very nice user profile page which also shows everything you have done on their website, starting from publishing to maintaining.

On their [tracks](https://exercism.org/tracks) page, you will get a list of 57 different programming languages where you can start your practice.

Solving problems on their website seems super fun to me. I really liked the way they manage their website.

## 18\. [Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/) (Commonly known as UVa)

![Online Judge banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/fat4pnmszr5xo5yqus73.png)

This is one of the oldest websites out there for solving programming-related problems. I still find it to be a very hard website for beginners. The UI and navigation of the website are also very old.

All of the questions come with a PDF here. You need to download the PDF file of the problem if you want to solve problems as they do not offer a direct preview of the questions.

They have a lot of problemsets on their [website](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8). I still find a lot of users using this website nowadays. Therefore, I mentioned it here.

## 19\. [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)

![HackerEarth banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/xm0bhrc4ephex78tddj5.png)

> HackerEarth is an Indian software company headquartered in San Francisco, US, that provides enterprise software that helps organisations with their technical hiring needs. HackerEarth is used by organizations for technical skill assessment and remote video interviewing.

You can practice your problem solving skills from their [practice](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/) page. Also, you can participate in programming challenges and hackathons from their [challenges](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/) page.

Their [interview prep](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/interviews/) section is quite amazing. You can take part in the mock assessments for the Adobe Coding Test, Facebook Coding Test, and Amazon Coding Test.

They also provide a nice user profile for everyone.

## 20\. [Code Jam - Google's Coding Competitions](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam)

![Code Jam banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/m8l89xfpsqt1yak0d94c.png)

> Google Code Jam is an international programming competition hosted and administered by Google. The competition began in 2003. The competition consists of a set of algorithmic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time.

If you are interested in taking part in the Code Jam contests, then their [archive section](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive) is full of amazing resources for you where you can get the earlier questions and practice them.

They also offer a lot of prize money in their contests. An example can be:

> Out of thousands of participants, only the top 25 will head to the World Finals to compete for the title of World Champion and cash prizes of up to $15,000. And there will be plenty of other prizes to go around — the top 1,000 competitors will win an exclusive Code Jam 2022 t-shirt.

## 21\. [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) - International Collegiate Programming Contest

![ICPC banner image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/m8w6ezori7cpgiytzxmi.png)

Who is eligible for ICPC?

> ACM/ICPC is a team-based competition with certain requirements to the participants: only post-secondary students and first-year post-graduate students no older than 24 are eligible; each team consists of three members. One can participate in the finals no more than twice and in the regionals no more than five times.

# Personal Opinion

If you are a complete beginner, then start with [beecrowd](#1beecrowdformerlyuri). If you want to start problem solving along with learning a specific programming language, then start with [HackerRank](#2hackerrank).

After solving almost 50+ problems on beecrowd or HackerRank, start solving problems on [Codeforces](#3codeforces). The first time, you won't be able to do that well in the programming contests on Codeforces, and that is completely okay – it is natural. You just need to try regularly. The questions might seem pretty hard to you, but it'll become easier day by day after solving problems continuously.

You can participate in [AtCoder](#7atcoder) the day you start solving problems on Codeforces. You can also try [CodeChef](#6codechef), but I find Codeforces is enough in this case.

This will prepare you for the [ICPC](#21icpcinternationalcollegiateprogrammingcontest) and [Code Jam](#20codejamgooglescodingcompetitions). Don't forget to solve the earlier questions on Code Jam.

If you want to gain expertise in Data Science, then simply go for [Kaggle](#5kaggle).

If you want to gain expertise in Algorithms, then [LeetCode](#4leetcode), and [LightOJ](#16lightoj) are your only places. [GeeksforGeeoks](#14geeksforgeekspopularlyknownasgfg) will also help you in this aspect.

For LeetCode, get some help from [Nick White](https://twitter.com/nicholaswwhite). His [LeetCode Solution](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU_sdQYzUj2keVENTP0a5rdykRSgg9Wp-) playlist has 189 videos as of today, and you will learn a lot from him, trust me!

Another good resource is [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) where you can get curated problems and their solutions from LeetCode. The official [YouTube channel of Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/c/NeetCode/featured) is also a great channel.
