![How to Use Google – Search Tips for Better Results](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2022/03/pexels-photomix-company-218717.jpg)

Google is the most powerful tool in the world if you know how to use it properly. Let me show you how to get better at Googling.

## 1\. Use Quotes for Exact-Match Search

You can use quotes to force an exact-match search. This is super useful if you know exactly the search phrase you're looking for. You'll simply get more accurate results if you do this.

`"what is javascript"`

## 2\. Use the AND Operator

The AND operator will return only results related to both terms. In the example bellow you can see the perfect use-case of this operator.

`html AND css`

## 3\. Use the OR Operator

You can use the OR operator to get results related to one of the search terms you enter.

`(javascript OR python) free course`

## 4\. Use the - (minus) Operator

The - operator will exclude results that contain a term or phrase. So, in our case we want to get JavaScript related results, but exclude any CSS results from them.

`javascript -css`

## 5\. Use (\*) wildcards as placeholders

You can use the (\*) wildcards as placeholders, which will be replaced by any word or phrase.

This one is my favorite. I use it when I know almost the whole search phrase and just replace the part I don't know with asterisk. Super useful.

`"how to start * in 6 months"`

## 6\. How to Search Inside a Single Website

This is another one I use frequently. If I'm searching for something in particular on a specific website, this is my approach.

`site:freecodecamp.org`

## 7\. How to Find a Specific File Type

You can also use this very useful feature to help you find a specific file type. It's handy if you're looking for some materials like PDFs. If you haven't used it before, from now on you will.

`filetype:pdf learn css`

## 8\. How to Search for a Range of Numbers

This can be anything at all. If you're looking to buy something that falls within a specific price range, or you're searching for results that include a specific range of years, this is for you.

`ecmascript 2016..2018`

## 9\. Use the `before` Operator

Use the before operator to return only results before a given date.  
You must provide year-month-day dates or only a year. For example:

`javascript before:2020`

## 10\. Use the `after` Operator

Use the after operator to return only results after a given date. You must provide year-month-day dates or only a year. Super useful if you want exclude outdated results.

`web development after:2020`

As you can see, Google can be a powerful tool if you know how to use it properly.
