![一个月之内参加 60 多场面试，我收获了什么？](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2020/06/header-image.png)

In this article, I’ll share my motivation for doing 60+ technical interviews in 30 days. More importantly, I’ll share lessons learned from my failures and my successes.
在这片文章中，我将分享自己在一个月内参加 60 多场面试的动机。更重要的是，我将分享从成功和失败中吸取的教训。

I’ve grouped the lessons into three categories to match the phases of a typical recruitment process.
为了匹配典型招聘的每个阶段，我将文章分成了三个部分。

While most of the lessons apply directly to software engineers and technical professionals, the principles behind these lessons can be applied to all careers. I hope you find something useful that you can apply to your professional lives.
虽然大多数的经验对于软件工程师和专业从事技术的人士直接适用，但是这些经验背后的原理也同样适用于所有的职业。我希望你能从中找到一些对你职业生涯有帮助的东西。

## How did I get started

## 我是怎么开始的

> “If you’re going to fail, do it fast.” — Unknown
> “如果你想要失败，那么做快点。” —— 匿名者说

Like any other software engineer, I’ve had different types of technical interviews - from the dreaded whiteboard coding interview to the unreal 45-minute coding challenge on platforms like HackerRank. While some of my experiences in these interviews were great, others were bad. Really bad.
就像任何其他的软件工程师一样，我经历了许多不同类型的技术面试 —— 从可怕的白板面试到在类似 HackerRank 等平台上的 45 分钟虚拟编码挑战。虽然其中一部分我经历的面试感觉很好，但是另外一些则很不好，非常糟糕的那种。

But I wanted to get really good at interviewing. I wanted to learn to overcome the interviewing phobia and exude confidence at interviews. Like a skilled surfer, I wanted to learn to ride the high pressure waves that came with interviews. I was also looking to change jobs at the time.
但是我想要变得非常善于面试。我想要克服面试恐惧症并在面试中表现自信。就像一个冲浪老手一样，我想要学习如何在波涛汹涌的面试高压浪潮中乘风破浪。我也想在此期间更换工作。

So from January through early March 2020, I applied to and was contacted by companies based in the US and Europe. From early-stage startups like Coda to later stage startups like Crunchbase, from mid-size companies like Affirm, to bigger companies like Amazon and even remote companies like Webflow.
所以从 2020 年的 1 月份到 3 月初，我申请并联系了在美国和欧洲的公司。从像 Coda 这样的早期初创公司，到像 Crunchbase 后期的创业公司，从像 Affirm 的中型公司，到像 Amazon 的超大型公司，甚至像 Webflow 这样的远程办公公司。

109+ applications later, I landed myself more than 60 interviews. These comprised more than 60 introductory phone interviews, 50+ technical phone screen interviews, 18 take-home coding projects, 11 coding challenges and 8 on-site interviews including 3 virtual ones.
超过 109 份面试申请后，我获得了超过 60 多场面试机会。其中包括 60 多场电话面试，50 多场技术视频面试，18 个可以线下在家实现的代码项目，11 个在线编码挑战，以及 8 场现场面试其中包括 3 场虚拟现场面试。

## What did I learn

## 我学到了什么

For better appreciation, I have grouped the lessons into three categories to match the different phases of a typical recruitment process.
为了更好的阅读体验，我将文章分成了 3 个部分，以匹配招聘过程中的不同阶段。

## Pre-Interview Phase

## 面试前阶段

This covers everything from the initial contact with a company to the point where the first interview happens.
这里涵盖了从和一家公司首次建立联系到得到第一次面试邀请的所有内容。

### What I learned about applications

### 我从面试申请中学到了什么

When I started applying to companies, I imagined that the more applications I submitted, the higher my chances of getting an interview would be. Seems logical, huh? So I set a target of 5 applications a day, aiming for 1 interview for every 5 applications.
当我开始向公司发送面试申请时，我想象着如果我发送的申请越多，我获得面试的机会可能就越高。看上去很合理，对吧？所以我设定了每天发送 5 份简历的计划，目标是每 5 份简历中就有 1 次面试机会

But my strategy didn’t work as I hoped it would. The number of interview requests I got often fell short of my target. It was almost a 1:12 ratio - 1 interview for every 12 applications.
但是计划没有如我所愿。面试邀请的数量经常达不到我的目标。这个比例大概是 1:12 —— 每 12 份简历申请获得 1 个面试机会。

I was faced with the question: do I need to increase my daily target to, say, 10 companies? Or was there something else I needed to change?
我面临的问题是：我应该增加每天投递简历的数量吗，比如每天 10 家公司？或者有什么其他地方是我需要改变的？

With every unsuccessful application, I saw that something needed to change.
从每次失败的投递中，我发现有些东西需要改变。

That change came when I took a break from meeting my daily numbers and began to think of my applications differently. I began to see each application as a sales pitch to the hiring manager or whoever was going to be reading my application, but here the product being sold was me.
发生这种变化的时候，我休息了一天的时间，并且开始重新思考我简历投递的方式。我开始将每份简历看成是向招聘经理的推销，或者任何想阅读我简历的人，但是现在出售的商品是我自己。

If a company needed to fill a talent gap and I say I had the skills, I needed to find a way to convince them that I did.
如果一家公司需要填补人才缺口，而我说我有这个能力，那么我需要寻找一个方法让他们相信我所说的。

My new task then became to find a way to effectively pitch **my unique skills, experience and personality** in a way that convinced the hiring manager that I was the right fit for the job.
我的新任务是找到一个能有效的推销**我的独特能力，经验和性格**的方法来让招聘经理相信我是这份工作的合适人选。

Here is an example of one of such _pitches_ I came up with:
这里是我提出 _推销_ 自己的一个例子：

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/06/body-image.png)

Backed with my resume, this cover letter had a 95% success rate. The one time this didn’t work, the hiring manager still replied to let me know that the position was no longer available but he would like to connect in the future.
在我这份简历的支持下，这份简历有 95% 的成功率。其中有一次不成功，但是招聘经理仍然回复我，让我知道这个岗位已经停止招聘了，但是也很愿意今后继续保持联系。

The lesson here is, be very intentional about the application you put forward – quality over quantity. Better still do both. Know your unique competencies and experience and present them in a way that matches the company’s needs without sacrificing your personality.
这里有个经验，你需要非常注意你简历的内容 —— 质量比数量更重要。当然能兼顾两者就更好了。了解你自己的特有的经验和能力，并以一种符合公司要求的方式表现出来而不失个性。

It is also important to understand the peculiarity of the company you are applying to and its specific needs. A startup or a smaller-sized company may have different needs from a bigger company, thus requiring a different skill-set.
了解你投递公司的背景和特殊需要同样也很重要。一家初创公司或者中小型公司可能与大公司的需求不同，因此需要一份不同的技能清单

Sell yourself and be sure to back your sales pitch during the interview.
推销你自己，并确保在面试中能支持你的销售内容

### What I learned about recruiter in-mails

### 我从招聘者的邮件中学到了什么

During this period, I received a number of in-mails from recruiters (mostly unsolicited) for open roles, the majority of which were roles I wasn’t interested in.
在此期间，我收到了一堆来自招聘者（大部分是不相关的）的开放职位招聘的邮件，其中大部分是我所不感兴趣的职位。

Granted, it was sometimes a lot given my busy schedule but I learned to be empathetic, understanding that these recruiters were only trying to do their jobs.
当然，看上去我的日程会因此变得忙碌起来，但是我可以理解，这些只是招聘者在完成本职工作。

I stopped seeing these in-mails as noise in my inbox and started making the effort to reply to all recruiter in-mails, even for positions I was not interested in. By doing this, I succeeded in building a network of recruiters that have become a rich resource if I have to switch roles in the future.
我不再将这些邮件视为噪音，并开始努力回复这些招聘者发送的邮件，甚至回复那些我不感兴趣的岗位。通过这样做，我成功的与这些招聘者建立了联系，如果将来我需要转行，这将为我提供丰富的资源。

Now I don’t expect you may want to start replying to every in-mail you receive. But it might interest you to know that some of the interview requests I got were from recruiters I had replied to before for roles I wasn’t interested in. It never hurts to reply.
现在，我不期望你回复每一封你收到的邮件。但是，你可能感兴趣的是，其中一部分的面试邀请是我从回复那些一开始我并不感兴趣的岗位招聘者中得到的。回复邮件并没什么坏处。

## The Interview Phase

## 面试阶段

This covers everything about the interview itself, cutting across the different interview types.
这里包含面试过程中的所有部分，我分成了几种不同的面试类型。

### How to handle introductory phone calls

### 如何处理介绍性电话面试

Yes I get it, you’re busy and many things are competing for your time. But hey, you are also an excellent professional, and that means you never get on a phone call without knowing at least these two things:
是的，我知道，你很忙，许多事情的处理需要占据你的时间。但是，你同样是一个专业人士，因此当你接到电话时你至少需要知道两件事：

-   the first name of your interviewer, and
-   面试官的姓名
-   at least one tangible thing about the company — what they do, where they are located, any recent news, something, anything!
-   至少得到一个公司的信息 —— 公司是做什么的，地址在哪，关于公司的新闻，或者其他和公司相关的事。

I noticed that for interviews where I put in the effort to make these findings, I always came across as being genuinely interested in the company. That’s something recruiters typically look for in these kinds of interviews.
我注意到，当我向面试中询问这些事情时，我总是发现自己真正对公司产生了兴趣。招聘者通常会在面试中寻找这种感觉。

### How to handle technical phone screens

### 如何处理电话技术面试

The one thing that can almost single-handedly decide how well you do in a technical phone screen interview is your ability to communicate your thoughts clearly.
能够清晰表达自己的想法是衡量你在电话技术面试中表现得有多好决定性的因素。

You may have heard stuff like this before:
你之前可能听过这个说法：

“_The interviewers care about your thought process. Yes they can see your code but importantly, they want to know **why** you are doing what you’re doing_.”
“_面试官关心的是你的思考过程。是的，他们能看到你的代码，但是更重要的是他们想要知道你**为什么**这样实现代码。_”

The interviewer isn’t there with you and so does not have the luxury of seeing other non-verbal cues like your hand gestures or nuances. All the interviewer has is your voice as a means of understanding your thought process.
面试官不在你旁边，所以你不要奢望看到其他非语言提示，例如手势或者其他细微动作。面试官所拥有的只有你用来表达思维的声音。

Now you know how you should lead this conversation, the next question is how do you become good at this? Because the truth is, while expressing your thoughts may come naturally to some people, it doesn’t to others – including me.
现在你知道了如何进行这次对话，接下来的问题是你怎么能够熟练应对？因为实际上，虽然表达您的想法对某些人来说很自然，但对其他人却不然，包括我在内。

So – Practice! Practice!! Practice!!!
所以 —— 练习！练习！练习！

Practice doing a lot of mock interviews. Doing these mock interviews with friends made me better and more confident in explaining my thought process. But more interestingly, it helped me develop a new mindset about interviews.
练习很多次模拟面试。与我的朋友进行模拟面试练习使我在表达自己观点的时候变得更加自信。但是更有趣的是，这也帮助我建立了一个新的面试观念。

I began to see interviews as a conversation with a friend or a team member. I visualized the interviewer on the other end as one of my friends (I sometimes gave the interviewer a name in my head). So what would have been a high-pressure interview I now saw as a friendly ‘chat’ about a technical problem.
我开始将面试看成是一场与朋友或者团队成员间的对话。我将面试官看成是我的朋友（我有时候在心里会给面试官取个名字）。因此，原本会是一场超高压力的面试，我现在会把它看做是一次友善的关于技术的 “聊天”。

This new mindset, aided by the many practice interviews, helped me grow in confidence so much so that I started enjoying interviews, sorry, technical chats.
通过许多场模拟面试，借助这个新观念，帮我树立了极大的信心，所以我开始享受面试，对不起，我是说技术聊天。

### How to get started on a problem

### 如何从一个问题下手

Never start solving a problem without fully understanding the problem statement. You are almost never wrong if you start by asking clarifying questions. It’s also a good sign to your interviewer when you ask those questions rather than run with your assumptions.
绝对不要在没有了解清楚问题说明的情况下，就开始解决它。如果你先有清晰明确的提问，那么你的答案也基本不会错。当你通过提问来明确问题而不是自我猜测，这对面试官来说也是件好事。

### How to solve the problem

### 如何解决这个问题

Good candidates know how to solve a problem (e.g. a sorting problem), but the best candidates know multiple solutions to a problem and understand the trade-offs of one solution versus the other.
好的候选人知道如何解决问题（例如一个排序问题），但是优秀的候选人知道一个问题的多种解决方案并且能权衡彼此之间的利弊。

The interviews where I performed the best (Cruise comes to mind) are the ones where I didn’t just solve the algorithmic challenge – I was also able to provide alternative solutions and discuss the trade-offs.
我表现最好的一场面试（思如泉涌）是我不但解决了逻辑问题 —— 我还提供了替代方案并且讨论了它们的利弊。

Aim to provide multiple solutions to a problem, be willing to discuss the trade-offs, and be able to implement at least one of them.
你的目标是提供多种解决方案，愿意讨论之间的不同，并且能够至少实现其中一种方案。

For technical interviews, write clean code. Most interviewers care about your code quality as well as the correctness of your solution. Aim for modular code, separate reusable logic into utility functions, name variables and methods properly, and just be a boss!
对于技术面试，编写简洁的代码。很多面试管都关心你的代码质量和解决方案的正确性。你的目标是模块化代码，拆分可复用的逻辑单元为一个个方法，正确的变量和方法名，就像老板管理公司一样管理你的代码！

### What to do when you’re stuck on a problem

### 当你在问题面前遇到阻碍怎么办

There will be times when you’re stuck. And this could be caused by a number of reasons: you don’t have the requisite knowledge, incorrect assumptions, missing details, and so on.
有时候你会被问题卡住，造成这些问题的原因有很多：你没有相应的知识，错误的假设，缺少详情等等。

I used to think that at such times I was being judged by how fast I could come up with a solution. So I would be quiet, thinking, not communicating with the interviewer, just thinking.
我曾经认为在这种情况下评判我的标准是我处理的问题有多快。所以我会变得安静，思考，不和面试官交流，只是自己思考。

And this is where a lot of us get it wrong. I get it, you need some alone time to think. But sorry to burst your bubble, that alone time is not when you’re being interviewed by a person.
这就是我们很多人误解的地方。我知道，你需要一段单独思考的时间。但是很抱歉，你的这个想法破灭了，独处在被人面试的时候是不允许的。

Yes, your interviewer wants to see that you can come up with a solution, but one thing you must not forget is that they also want to see that you can **collaborate with other team-mates** to come up with a solution. While companies want rock-stars, they also want team-players.
是的，你的面试官希望看到你想出解决方案，但是有一件事你不能忘记，他们也希望看到你能够**与团队同事一起合作**讨论出解决方案。虽然公司希望有大牛，但他们也想要团队合作。

Since your interviewer is a friend, a buddy, a team member who’s on your side and means well for you (Refer to 4), talk to them while you're figuring it out.
因为你把面试官当成你的朋友，熟人，你身边的团队成员，他们都对你是友好的（参考第4部分电话技术面试），所以处理问题时大胆和他们交流。

Share your thought process up till the point you got stuck and do it confidently, not like some cry for help. By doing so you just may uncover the solution, as was the case during my interview with Coda.
自信的分享你的思考过程，直到遇到困难为止，而不是像某些人立刻喊着要帮助。通过这样的方式，你可能找到解决方案，就像我在面试 Coda 时遇到的情况一样。

### How to handle coding challenges

### 如何应对编码挑战

The lessons here apply to interviews that take the form of coding challenges on platforms like Hackerrank, Codility, and so on. Typically these are timed challenges, say 45 minutes or sometimes could be more.
这部分内容适用于在像 Hackerrank，Codility 等这样的平台上进行编码挑战形式的面试。通常这些是定时挑战，比如45分钟或者可能更长的时间。

Some of the lessons I shared earlier are useful here, while others like asking clarifying questions don’t apply since there’s no one to ask. So here are some steps I recommend: 
我之前分享的一些内容在这里很有用，但是其他的诸如明确一个问题等在这里并不适用，因为这里没有你能问的人。所以我建议利用这些步骤：

-   Read through and fully understand the problem.
1. 通读并明确问题
-   Write code that works first, even if it’s a [brute-force algorithm][1]. It may not pass all the test cases but get some working code out there first, hopefully within the first 15–20 minutes.
2. 先编写能运行的代码，即便是[暴力匹配算法][1]。它可能不会跑通所有的测试用例，但是首先要有能够运行的代码，理想的情况是在 15-20 分钟内编写出来。
-   Test your code with different input types, as this helps you handle edge cases.
3. 通过输入不同的用例测试你的代码，因为这有助于你处理边界情况。
-   Optimize for efficiency.
4. 优化执行效率。
-   Repeat Steps 4 and 5, till the very last minute.
5. 重复步骤4和5，直到最后一分钟。

A good grasp of computer science fundamentals is key here. I’ve added some links to helpful resources in the Resources section below.
这里的关键是掌握良好的计算机基础知识。我在文章底部中添加了一些相关的资料。

### How to handle take-home projects

### 如何应对线下代码编写的面试题

Take home projects are an opportunity to really shine because you have more time. This also means they can be time-consuming.
带回家写的项目是一个能展示你亮点的机会，因为你有更多的时间。这同样意味着可能会花费一些时间。

One of the companies I interviewed with provided hourly pay, about \$68/hr, for the number of hours you worked on their take-home project — it’s that serious, so you should be serious about it. Be sure you really want to be a part of a company before investing your time in the take-home projects.
我面试的其中一家公司是按时薪，大概每小时68美元，支付你编写他们的线下项目 —— 他们很认真的对待这个项目，所以你也应该认真对待。在你开始花时间写项目前，请想清楚你是否真的想成为这家公司的一员。

Never compromise on code quality for take-home projects. Be very intentional about your design decisions, naming conventions, code structure and so on, and be ready to defend your choices. 
不要在带回家的项目中牺牲代码质量。对你的整体框架设计，命名约定，代码结构等要非常用心，并且准备坚持自己的选择。

### What tools should you use

### 你应该使用哪些技术

During my interview with Course Hero, I used [regex][2] to solve a problem I could have solved using a simpler string parsing algorithm. It turned out to be a bad decision as I didn’t pass the interview.
在面试 Coures Hero 中，我使用了[正则表达式][2]解决问题，我本可以使用相对简单的字符串解析法。事实证明这是一个错误的决定，因为我没有通过面试。

The lesson: only use tools you’re **very** comfortable with and have **a lot** of experience with.
教训：只用你用起来**非常**熟悉的且有**很多**经验的技术。

### How to approach on-site interviews

### 如何处理现场面试

Get a good night's sleep the night before. Arrive early on the day of your interview and smile a lot (it helps portray confidence, but more importantly helps you stay relaxed and be in control).
前一晚睡个好觉。面试的那天早点到，多微笑（这有助于提升自信，但是更重要的是能够帮助你保持轻松的状态并控制自己）。

Confront your fears and accept that even if this doesn’t work out it’s not going to be the end of the world – after all you’re just going to have another technical chat. Then go in and absolutely chat away.
直面并接受你的恐惧，即使不能解决问题，这也不会是世界末日 —— 毕竟你只是进行了一场技术交流。然后沉浸到纯粹的交谈中。

**How to approach virtual on-site interviews**
**如何进行在线面试**

These can be very different from on-site interviews because everybody’s eyes are on you – **literally –** and that can be nerve-racking.
这可能会和线下直接面试有很大的不同，因为所有人的眼睛都看着你，并且会令人不安。

I had three virtual on-site interviews and I didn’t pass any of them. Sorry I’m not your guy for this one, but I’ve shared some resources that I think you may find helpful below.
我有过3次线上面试，而且没有通过任意一场。抱歉，我不是你要寻找的那个线上面试很在行的人，但是我在文章底部分享了一些可能对你有帮助的资源。

## After the Interview

## 面试结束后

### How to handle failure

### 如何面对失败

There are many reasons why you didn’t pass an interview. Some of the best engineers I know have failed interviews at some point and still do.
有很多原因导致你没有通过面试。有些我知道的最好的工程师在某些时候也没有通过面试，而且现在依然如此。

So separate failed interviews from yourself, look for the learning points from each failed interview, and use those to forge ahead. As they say – we move!
所以忘掉那些失败的面试，从每次失败的面试中吸取经验，并利用这些让自己进步。就像他们说的 —— 我们向前进！

### What about success

### 那么成功呢

Celebrate your successes, regardless of how small you think they are. I have a few ideas for celebration.
庆祝你的成功，无论是你认为多么小的成功。我有一些庆祝的点子。

## Am I better after doing this

## 这样处理之后我有进步吗？

I’m not going to tell you that I've aced every interview that has come my way since I embarked on this journey. But assuredly, I can tell you I have gotten better at interviewing and my confidence levels have really grown. And yes, I also got multiple offers too 😊.
我不是告诉你，自从我开始面试之旅，我完成了每次面试。但是可以肯定的是，我在每场面试之后都变得更擅长面试，而且我的自信心等级也真正的提升了。是的，我也同时获得了很多入职邀请。

## What should you do next

## 接下来你该怎么办

-   Practice doing a lot of mock interviews with friends. While I don’t totally agree that practice makes perfect (because perfection sounds like a moving target to me) practice helps you **quickly** identify patterns in interview questions, grow in mastery and ultimately your confidence.
- 和朋友进行多次模拟面试联系。虽然我不是完全同意熟能生巧（因为完美对我来说像是一个移动的目标），但是练习能够帮助你**快速**地辨识出面试问题的模式，熟练掌握，最终树立起你的自信心。
-   For technical interviews, nothing beats a very good understanding of the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. I’ve added links to resources I think you may find helpful.
- 对于技术面试，熟练掌握数据结构和算法能够打败一切。我在文章底部分享了一些可能对你有帮助的资源。

-   Start interviewing and keep interviewing. Even if you have a job, aim to interview every now and then — maybe once every other month or a quarter. Interviewing is a skill, so keep honing it.
- 开始面试，并持续面试。即使你有一份工作，也要不停的面试 —— 可能每个月一次或者每个季度一次面试。面试是一种技巧，所以要不断磨练。

I really hope this was helpful to you. And hopefully some of the lessons shared here will make you more confident and better at interviewing – and will ultimately help you land that job you really want.
我真心希望这片文章对你有所帮助。希望这里分享的一些经验教训将有助于你在面试时更加自信，面试表现更好 —— 最终将帮助你找到真正想要的工作。

If you ever need someone to do a mock interview with you, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [**@meekg33k**][3].
