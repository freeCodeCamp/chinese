Whether you're a new developer or you've been in the game for a while, you might be thinking about doing some freelance work.

无论你是初来乍到的开发新人，还是有一定经验的开发者，你可能都在琢磨着做些自由职业工作。

If you're thinking about striking out on your own, you'll likely have two questions. First, you may ask “what is freelancing?” This is understandable, given that the phrase can mean different things to different people.

如果你想自己闯出一片天来，你可能会遇到两个问题。你首先可能会问的是“什么是自由职业？”。这可以理解，因为对不同的人来说，这个词意味着不同的东西。

The second question you might have is how you can get clients. This is, of course, important, since working for yourself without having any customers will result in you looking like this:

其次，你可能想知道的是如何获得客户。当然，这一点很重要，因为在没有任何客户的情况下为自己工作将会把你让你看起来像下面这个样子：

The good news, if you're thinking of spinning up your own brand, is that if you go about it right then you can wind up looking like this:

好消息是，如果你正考虑做大你自己的品牌，只要你做对了，你也可以看起来像下面这个样子：

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/money-and-computer.jpg)

So, with all that said, let’s first answer the question “what is freelancing?” And then, let’s talk about how to get clients online as well as locally in your city.

综上所述，咱们先来回答“什么是自由职业？”这个问题。然后，咱们再讨论如何在自己的城市中获得网上的和本地的客户。

If you're like me and prefer to take in written content, read on. For those who prefer video, I've prepared a video presentation on these topics:

如果你像我一样偏爱书面内容，就继续读下去。如果你更喜欢视频，我也准备了一个有关这些话题的视频演讲：

I’ve written for freeCodeCamp on  [how to make money as a freelance developer][1]. I’ve also written a  [comprehensive guide to working as a freelancer][2]. This article is going to be different in that it is going to solely focus on two issues.

我为 freeCodeCamp 写了[自由开发者如何赚钱][1]，还写了[自由职业者完全指南][2]。本文会和它们有所不同，只会关注两个话题：

First, I’ll give my personal opinion as to what it means to be a freelance developer. Second, I’ll give my thoughts on getting the customers once you’ve struck out on your own.

第一，我将发表我对成为自由开发者的个人观点。第二，我将告诉你在开始之后如何获得客户。

I'll break the latter of these points into three parts. First, I'll discuss the tasks you should complete before you even begin attempting to get customers. Next, I will go over how to get clients through your online presence. The third part will cover ways in which you can get customers locally in your own city.

我将把后者分成三部分：首先，我将讨论你在尝试获得客户之前应该完成的事情。然后，我会讲如何通过在线形象（online presence）获得客户。第三部分会覆盖获得同城客户的各种方式。

## What does it mean to be a freelance developer

## 成为自由开发者意味着什么

[back to top][7]

[回到顶部][7]

The term “freelance” has been thrown around a lot in today’s society (including in lots of areas outside of software development). So much so that it has really become a buzzword that can mean different things to different people.

在当今社会，“自由职业（freelance）”一词的使用非常广泛（包括很多软件开发之外的领域），它已经成为了一个对不同人有着不同的含义的流行语。

If you’re thinking of striking out and doing your own thing, then being a “freelancer” can really mean one of two things.

如果你正想出来闯一闯，那么成为一个“自由职业者（freelancer）”就真的意味着两件事：

First, you may be considering creating your own side-hustle. Second, you may be thinking of actually being self-employed. Let’s look at each of these in turn.

其一，你可能正想开始做自己的副业。其二，你可能正想成为个体户。我们来依次看一下。

### Some people choose to hold a steady job while running a development business on the side

### 一些人一边从事稳定工作，一边经营开发业务

Going out on your own can be a great way to supplement your current job. Maybe you’re completing freeCodeCamp and are hoping to work a dev job at a company while doing projects on the side.

独自做副业是贴补当前工作的一个好方法。或许你正在完成 freeCodeCamp 并希望一边从事公司的开发岗一边做项目。

You may also have a non-software related job, that you want to keep, but you would like to be a part-time developer on the side.

你可能也有一份舍不得放弃的与软件无关的工作，但你又想成为一名兼职开发者。

In either of these cases, your business is a part-time activity. Since you already have a full-time commitment it’s unlikely that you’ll work with more than a few clients (or maybe even only one) at a time.

在这两种情况下，你的业务都是兼职活动。由于你已经有了一份全职工作，你一次与几个（可能甚至只有一个）客户合作是不太可能的。

When going this route, getting customers is still important, so the tips below will apply to you even though you’re not necessarily trying to scale up your business.

当你走这条路线时，获得客户也是很重要的。因此，即使你没必要扩大业务规模，下面的几点也会适用于你。

One of the downsides of going the side-hustle route is that it means working a full-time job while trying to run your business. While this comes with the benefit of having steady income (from your primary job), it comes with the downside of being  _really_  busy.

做副业的一个缺点就是你需要在经营自己业务的同时从事一份全职工作。这么做的好处是有主业为你提供的稳定收入，而缺点是你会变得 _真的_ 很忙。

Going this route tends to result in Friday only meaning that there are two more working days before Monday. It also comes with the stress of not being able to respond to your customers right away because you have your main job to deal with. These are just some of the ups and downs of going this route.

这条路线往往会将周六和周日变成两个额外的工作日，也会给你带来不能立即响应客户的压力，因为你需要应付你的主要工作。这些只是路线上的一些起伏。

### Some people may choose to make their development business their sole occupation

### 一些人可能选择专职经营开发业务

Many individuals either leave their current software job, or start out their development career, by working for themselves primarily and not as a side-hustle.

很多人将副业变成了主业，他们要么辞去了当前所从事的软件工作，要么刚开始从事开发工作。

This allows you to focus more on development of your own products and working for your own customers. As a result, you have much more flexibility with your schedule, since you’re not juggling against a full-time job.

这样，你就能集中注意力开发自己的产品和为客户效劳。由于你没了全职工作的束缚，你的时间变得更加灵活了。

Some who go this route are attempting to grow as much as possible while some are just hoping to maintain a steady stream of income and have a flexible lifestyle.

在这条路线上，一些人尽可能地扩张业务，而另一些人却只希望维持稳定的收入来源并拥有灵活的生活方式。

Focusing solely on your own thing can result in having a much higher income. This is because I, and many others, find it easier to make more when working for yourself than when working for a paycheck from a company.

完全专注于自己的事情可以让你的收入大幅提高。为什么这么说呢？因为我和许多人发现为自己工作比从公司领工资要容易得多。

The biggest downside of going this route, however, is the fact that you have no other income stream. This means that your income will be unsteady at best.

然而，走这条路最大的缺点就是你没有其它的收入来源，即你的收入会变得不稳定。

You may have noticed that neither of the aforementioned descriptions mentioned employees. That’s because once you get to the point of having employees, you’re no longer a “freelancer” - you’re a business owner.

你可能已经注意到了，上面提到的两种方式中都没有提到雇佣员工。因为一旦你有了员工，你就不再是一名“自由职业者”了——你是一位企业主。

In a future article (spoiler alert), I’ll discuss how to scale your freelance dev gig into a full fledged business.

在将来的一篇文章中（剧透一下），我会探讨如何将兼职自由开发工作扩大成为成熟的业务。

Which route you decide to take is really up to you. Just remember that it’s important to base your choice on your personal situation, preferences, and what it is you want going forward.

在这条路上，你想做什么就做什么。只要记住，根据你的自身情况、喜好以及你想要得到的一切做选择是很重要的。

Now let’s talk about what going forward looks like.

现在让我们继续往下讨论。

## What to do before you try to get new customers

## 在尝试获取新客户之前，你该做什么

[back to top][8]

[回到顶部][8]

The best way to grow your business is to do a good job for your existing customers. But before you can worry about that, you have to set up your branding.

扩张你的业务的最好方式就是把现有客户的工作做好。不过，在你创建自己的品牌之前，不需要为此操心。

Not setting up branding, which I’ll discuss in a moment, means that you go out and try to get business before potential customers might be willing to take you seriously.  _Don’t do that._

简单说一下，如果你没创建自己的品牌就出去尝试获得生意了，潜在客户可能并不会把你的话当真。_不要这么做。_

So….two tasks to complete before even attempting to get new customers are:

因此，在你尝试获取新客户之前要完成的两个任务是：

1.  Understand the importance of repeat business & referrals, and
2.  Set up your branding.

1. 理解回头客与推荐的重要性，并且
2. 建立自己的品牌。

Let’s look at each of these in turn.

让我们依次来看看这几点。
### Freelance developers must focus on existing customers if they want to grow their business

### 自由开发者要想扩大业务，必须重视现有客户

If you ask anyone who has their own business (not just developers) how to grow sales, they’ll almost immediately start talking about marketing of some sort. In other words, they focus entirely on getting inquiries from people who haven’t yet heard of them.

如果你向任何一位企业主（不一定是开发者）询问如何实现销售增长，他们很有可能会立即开始谈论某种形式的营销手段。换句话说，他们的注意力全都集中在如何收到来自陌生人的问询。

These business owners often devote time and other resources to marketing and, as a result, they take time and resources away from serving their current customers. I refer to this approach, in very technical terms, as:

这些企业主通常将时间和其它资源花在营销上，结果就是他们没有把时间和资源用来服务现有的客户。我用一个非常专业的词来称呼这种做法：

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/wrong-1.jpeg)

When you take time and resources away from your current customers, then those individuals/companies are waiting longer to get their product, they're waiting longer to hear back from you if they have questions, and are less likely to be happy with the service they’ve received.

当你把时间和资源从现有客户身上挪走后，他们在获得自己的产品之前就要等更长的时间。当他们遇到问题时，等你回应的时间也会更长。因此，他们不太可能对自己收到的服务感到满意。

They, in turn, are then less likely to call you for future work and are less likely to refer you to anyone.

反过来，他们就不太可能在以后再次找你做事，也不太可能把你推荐给别人。

The results of this can be disastrous. This disaster comes from the fact that not having repeat business or referrals means that you are one-hundred percent reliant on getting your customers from advertising or some form of networking.

这带来的后果是灾难性的。为什么这么说呢？因为没有回头客和别人的引荐意味着你只能通过广告或者某种联系来获得客户。

Suppose you’re spending money or time to get new customers (money in the form of advertising and time in the form of networking/reaching out). That time and money means that your profit margins are going to be low.

假如你正为招揽新客户花钱或花时间（钱用来打广告，时间用来联系客户），而那耗费的金钱和时间意味着你的利润会变低。

First, suppose you charged $3,000 for a website, but spent $250 in marketing to get the customer. This means that your profit is only $2,750.

首先，假设你为做一个网站收费三千美元，但为了找到客户，你将二百五十美元投入了市场，这意味着你的收益只有两千七百五十美元。

Second, suppose you charge $3,000 and can complete the product in fifteen hours. That’s $200 per hour. But if you spent 2-3 hours networking to get the customer, then you have to consider how that time impacts the amount you are making per hour.

其次，假设你收费三千美元并能在十五个小时内做完，那就是时薪两百美元。但是如果你花了二至三个小时联系客户，你就不得不考虑时间是如何影响你的时薪了。

Incurring these financial costs and time losses means that you’re going to struggle to make any money. This is not the case when you build up a referral base and repeat business base.

你需要努力赚钱才能承担这些商业开销和时间损失。但如果你建立了推荐基础和回头客基础，这就不是问题了。

Let’s look at how things go when you focus on your existing customers first. Yes, you spend some form of resources to get a customer. But then that customer is likely to come back to you in the future when you need something else. This means you pick up additional work without spending any additional resources.

我们先来看看当你专注于现有客户时，事情会怎么发展。没错，你为获得客户而花费了某种形式的资源，但是当你将来需要其它东西的时候，这个客户很有可能会再来找你。这意味着你在没有花费任何额外的资源的情况下就获得了额外的活儿。

Second, they then refer you new potential customers - meaning that you get new business without expending  _any_  time or resources. This drives up your profit margins, leads to exponential growth, and helps you look like this:

其次，他们会把你推荐给潜在的新客户——意味着你不花费 _任何_ 时间或资源就可以获得新的生意。这会抬高你的利润率，带来指数增长，助你财源广进：

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/computer-and-money.jpg)

I’ll explain with a personal example.

我用一个个人例子进行解释。

I built a website for a lawyer in 2013. She was extremely happy with the service I provided and roughly six months later had me build a second website for a niche legal area she was going to begin handling. I’ve also provided ongoing maintenance to the lawyer for several years now.

我在 2013 年为一位律师做了一个网站。她对我提供的服务感到非常满意，并且在六个月之后就让我为一个她即将面对的专业法律领域建了第二个网站。到现在为止，我已经为持续那位律师提供了好几年的维护了。

Importantly, this same lawyer has referred two more people. The first of these two people hired me and, in addition to building out their initial product, they have also hired me for ongoing support and maintenance.

重要的是，这个律师给我推荐了另外两个人。他们中的第一个人除了雇我增建他们最初的产品外，还雇我进行持续支持与维护。

So, I put time into going out and getting a customer (the lawyer) and the time I spent meeting with one person has resulted in my building three different websites and providing additional maintenance services.

因此，我把时间用在出去找一个客户（那位律师）上面，然后我花在与一个人见面上的时间给我带来了三个不同的网站建设工作以及额外的维护服务。

For obvious reasons, this is more profitable than going out and having to meet three different people to get three separate jobs. Exponential growth can occur in your business when you take one inquiry (the lawyer, in my case) and turn it into several jobs over a period of time.

很明显，这比出去见三个不同的人并获得三份不同的工作更能获利。当你进行一次询问（我的例子中的那位律师）并在一段时间内将其变成好几份工作，你的生意就会暴涨。

Building up a referral base means, again, focusing on your existing customers first. This approach is simple. If you have something to do, or something you can do, for a current customer, then do it. If you have time left over at the end of the week, then such time can be devoted to going out and trying to get new customers.

建立推荐基础意味着要先将你的精力集中在现有客户身上。做法很简单，如果你要为或者能为一位当前客户做点什么，去做就是了。如果你在周末还有剩余时间的话，你可以把这些时间用来找寻新的客户。

I cannot stress enough how important it is to your growth that you take a “current customer first” focus.

我已经再三强调了“当前客户优先”对你成长的重要性。

### Self-employed developers should establish their branding before trying to get new customers

### 自由开发者在尝试获取客户之前应该建立自己的品牌

The next thing you should do as a self-employed developer is establish your branding before attempting to meet new customers.

作为一名自由开发者，你尝试会见新客户之前应该做的下一件事情就是建立自己的品牌。

Understanding why requires you to put yourself in the role of a small business owner.

好好理解一些为什么要求你扮演一个小企业主。

Suppose you own the local bakery and someone comes in offering their website & app development services to the bakery. If the developer doesn’t even have a website of their own, has no portfolio of work, no online reviews, no business cards, and is using a personal email address for work purposes, then the business owner isn’t going to take them seriously.

假设你在当地有一家面包房，然后有人走进来说他们可以为你的面包房提供网站和应用开发服务。如果那位开发者连自己的网站都没有，没有作品集、没有在线评价、没有名片，而只有用于工作的个人邮箱，你是不会把他当真的。

Instead, it is much better to get these things knocked out before even attempting to meet a client.

相反，在尝试与客户见面之前，你最好把这些东西都准备好。

The first order of business is to build out the website for your business and to display your portfolio of work (you can have a portfolio even if you haven’t had any clients yet).

你的首要任务是为自己的业务建立一个网站，然后在上面放上你的作品集（即使你现在没有任何客户，你也是可以有作品集的）。

In terms of putting together your own site, you can do it yourself or, to save time, you can use a template from  [html5up][9]  (make sure you follow the creative commons licensing if you use one of these templates).

在整合网站这件事情上，你可以自己做，或者如果你想节省时间的话，也可以使用 [html5up][9] 提供的模板（如果你使用了其中的模板，确保你遵循了知识共享许可）。

For your portfolio, I’d suggest including at least five to six projects. If you haven’t completed anything yet, then you can create mock ups and include them.

对于作品集，我建议你至少放五到六个项目进去。如果你现在一个项目也没有完成过，你也可以把你制作的原型放进去。

An example of this would be creating a website for a fictional bakery and including it in your portfolio. Just make sure it is clear that, when someone clicks on that site from your portfolio, they will be viewing a demo and that it is not a real business.

举个例子，你可以为一个虚拟的面包房创建一个网站并将他放到你的作品集中。你只需要保证，当某人从你的作品集上点击那个网站时，他们可以清晰的看到一个示例并知道那并不是真实的业务。

Having a professional looking website, and a portfolio of quality work, makes you appear more legitimate to potential clients.

当潜在客户寻找候选人时，拥有一个专业的网站和一份高质量的作品集的你会显得更加合适。

The second thing to get done right away is to set up online review profiles for your business. Whenever a client is happy with you, it’s important to ask them to leave you good reviews online. The presence of these reviews helps ensure that future customers are more likely to hire you.

你需要马上做的第二件事情是：为你的业务设立线上评论主页。每当有客户对你感到满意时，请他们在线上给你留下好评非常重要，因为这些评价会增大你在将来被其它客户雇佣的可能性。

The two most important places to have review profiles, in my opinion, are Google and Facebook. This means that you need to start a  [Google my Business][10]  account for your new brand. You also need to create a Facebook page for the brand.

在我看来，展示评价的最重要的两个地方分别是 Google 和 Facebook，所以你需要为自己的新品牌注册一个 [Google my Business][10] 账户，或者为它创建一个 Facebook 页面。

When you’ve completed a project and the customer was clearly happy with your services, you’ll want to send them links to these profiles so they can leave you good reviews.

在你做完了一个项目之后，如果客户很明显地表现出了对你的服务满意性，你就可以给他们发送这些评价页面的链接，以便他们可以给你留下好评。

The final step in being ready to market yourself is to set up a branded email, order business cards, and get a business phone number.

推销自己之前的最后一步就是设立一个品牌邮箱、订购名片并准备一个办公用的电话号码。

For your cards, I would suggest going the simple route. This means using a service such as Vista Print. Setting up your email is self-explanatory.

对于名片，我建议你走简洁路线，比如使用像 Vista Print 这样的服务。设立的邮箱最好是自解释的。

As for your phone number, I would use a free service such as Google Voice, which allows you to have a dedicated number which will ring to your cell. Once you have all of these items completed, you’re ready to go and to start hustling up business.

至于电话号码，我会使用像 Google Voice 这样的免费服务，这类服务会给你一个专用号码，然后你可以通过手机接听这个号码的电话。一旦你完成了所有这些事项，你就做好准备了，现在开始做你的业务吧。

## How to get clients online as a freelance developer

## 自由开发者如何在线上获得客户

[back to top][11]

[回到顶部][11]

If you have a quality web presence, it can result in an ongoing stream of business for you as a freelance developer. When establishing your online presence, however, it is important that you go about it the right way.

一个良好的网络形象能给你这个自由开发者带来源源不断的业务。然而，在建立你的在线形象时，以正确的方式去做是很重要的。

I strongly, strongly, strongly (strongly) suggest that you invest into your web presence as opposed to spending time and resources on it.

与在业务上投入时间和资源不同，我强烈建议你在网络形象上投资。

Because this point – investment – is so crucial, it’s the first point I’m going to discuss in this section of this article. I’ll then talk about optimizing your website for your local market and will then briefly make a few additional points about getting online reviews.

因为投资这个点太关键了，它将是我在这个部分讨论的第一个点。我稍后会讨论如何争对当地市场而进行的网站优化，还会简单讲几个关于获取在线评价的点。

### You should invest in your online presence as opposed to spending on it

### 你应该在你的在线形象投资，而不是在其上花钱

One of the things I am most thankful for is that I came to appreciate the difference between investing and spending, in terms of my business, at a very early stage.

我最感激的事情之一就是：在我开展业务的初期，我就明白了投资与支出的区别。

The concept is straightforward. When you invest in your web presence, you then own something at the end of the day. These owned items can take the form of blog posts, YouTube videos, and so on. You don’t have to expend any more money or time to keep these assets and no one can take them from you.

它们的概念很简单。当你在网络形象上投资时，你总会在一天结束时拥有点自己的东西。这些拥有物的形式可以是博客文章、Youbute 视频等等。这些资产不需要你再花任何额外的金钱或时间来维持，因为没有人能够从你手中夺走它们。

Spending money on your web presence, by contrast, involves renting ad space from third parties (which can include pay-per-click advertising, Facebook ads, and so on.).

相比之下，在网络形象上花钱通常包括从第三方租广告空间（比如点击付费（pay-per-click）广告、Facebook 广告等等），

Investing in your online presence can result in your profits going up like this:

在自己的网络形象上投资可以让你的收益像下面这样增长：

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/11/upwardgraph.jpg)

While simply throwing money at it can result in a constant struggle and will make moving your business forward about as easy as actually getting somewhere on a treadmill.

然而，简单地在它上面砸钱不仅会让你苦苦挣扎，还会轻而易举地将你的业务变得枯燥无味。

Let’s look at why this is.

我们来看看为什么。

Suppose you spend $1,000 on advertising this month. Now suppose it brings you $10,000 in revenue. It’s easy to look at that and go “woo hoo!”

假设你这个月在广告上投入了一千美元，然后它给你带来了一万美元的收益。这看起来很容易，也比较容易让人兴奋。

But there’s a problem. The $1,000 you spent on advertising is now gone and will never bring you anything past the initial $10,000. Moreover, if you don’t spend money advertising again next month then your revenue will go to zero.

但是这有一个问题：你用来打广告的一千美元现在已经是泼出去的水了，除了最初的一万美元，它不会再给你带来任何收益。你下个月还需要继续花钱做广告，否则你的收益就会变成零。

This means, with a near certainty, that relying on paid ads for your online presence will lock you into recurring advertising costs that you’ll never get out of. This is a far cry from actually owning your marketing assets.

几乎可以肯定的是，依靠付费广告的网络形象会让你掉进不断花钱打广告的无底洞。和拥有你自己的市场资产相比，这就差远了。

I’m going to use a personal example to demonstrate the value of owning your web presence outright.

为了展示拥有自己网络形象的价值，我要举一个个人例子。

My previous brand was acquired in May of 2020. Over the years I had written roughly four hundred blog articles targeting my potential customers. From the time I launched the website through its acquisition, my top performing blog post had received over 10,000 clicks in search.

我之前的品牌在 2020 年五月份被收购了。这些年来，我已经写了大概四百篇以我的潜在客户为目标的博客文章。从网站的建立到被收购的时间内，我最好的那篇博客已经收到了超过了一万次的点击量。

If I had been using pay-per-click advertising to get customers, then I probably would have spent somewhere in the area of $10 per click. So that  _one_  blog article that got 10,000 clicks gave my business the equivalent of $100,000 in advertising ($10 x 10,000).

如果我一直使用点击计费的模式招揽客户，我的钱可能就花在了某个点击一次十美元的地方。因此 _一篇_ 收获了一万次点击的博文相当于给我自己的业务做了十万美元的广告（$10 x 10,000）。

I probably spent a total of five to six hours researching and writing that one article. Once that time was spent, however, I never put another moment into that article – I owned it.

我总共大概花了五至六个小时的研究并撰写那篇文章。然而，除了最开始投入的时间，我就没有再在那篇文章上花其它的时间了——我已经拥有了它。

This is different from paying for an ad where you don’t own anything at the end of the day. If you own your online presence then you can grow your business exponentially and avoid large recurring marketing costs.

这与不会让你拥有任何东西的付费广告截然不同。如果你拥有自己的在线形象，你不仅能迅速扩张业务，还能避免大量反复出现的营销成本。

Again, the assets you own can take on multiple forms. In addition to blog articles, consider YouTube videos and other media which can be used to target your potential market (more on this below).

再次强调，你拥有的资产可以体现为多种形式。除了博文，你也可以考虑下 Youtube 视频和能用来吸引潜在客户的其它媒体。

One point I want to emphasize is that you  _can_ create content which you will own. I’ve spoken with a lot of developers over the years who didn’t write blog articles or create videos because they felt uncomfortable doing so.

我想强调的一点就是：你 _能够_ 创建你自己将会拥有的内容。这些年来，我对很多开发者这么讲过。这些开发者不写任何博客，也不制作任何视频，原因居然是它们觉得做这些很不自在。

While I understand and appreciate this, it’s crucial for you to understand that working for yourself means doing a lot of things you don’t feel comfortable doing.

虽然我很理解他们，但对你来说，懂得“为自己工作意味着你要做很多令自己不爽的事情”这个道理至关重要。

If you’re unwilling to create web content that you own, and you choose to rely on ads, then you will still be able to make money as a freelance developer. That money, however, will be nowhere near what you can earn if you choose to step out of your comfort zone a little bit and engage in regular content creation.

如果你不愿制作自己的网络内容，还是选择依靠广告的话，你也是可以以一名自由开发者的身份赚钱的。然而，那些钱远远比不上你稍微跳出舒适区并进行常规内容创作所挣到的钱。

So, with that said, let’s move on to actually building out your web presence.

说完这些，咱们继续向前，看一看该打造你的网络形象。

### You must optimize your web presence for a target market

### 你需要针对目标市场对网络形象进行优化

I’ve seen a lot of independent developers who put together a website for their business without making sure it’s actually targeting a preferred market. Instead, such websites tend to be overly broad or vague.

我见过很多将所有业务都放在一个网站上的独立开发者，他们没有特定的市场偏好。这些网站通常会显得过于宽泛或模糊。

Such a website may simply say “I’m a developer who builds stuff for the web” or something of the sort. They then link to a portfolio of various projects, list languages and frameworks that they are familiar with, and that’s it.

这样的网站可能只是在简单地告诉别人“我是一个写网站的开发者”，或者类似的信息。它们通常会链接到一份含有各种各样项目的作品集，作品集罗列着他们熟悉的语言和框架，就是这样。

Instead, it’s best to identify a market you can reach through your website and optimize your site for it.

相反，最好是让你的网站展示一个你能做的市场，并在网站上做相关优化。

I’ll be writing more on freeCodeCamp over the next few months about optimizing websites for search (so stay tuned). For right now, prior to building out your website, I’d suggest you familiarize yourself with  [Google’s SEO starter guide][12]. Then identify a market segment that you think you can capture and optimize your website for it.

接下来的几个月，我会在 freeCodeCamp 写更多关于针对搜索引擎优化网站的文章（敬请期待）。现在，我建议你在建立自己的网站之前先熟悉 [Google 的 SEO 入门指南][12]。然后，找一个你觉得你可以胜任的细分市场，并针对它优化你的网站。

To do this, make sure that your website clearly spells out different services and is clear about what you do.

为此，确保你的网站能清晰的说明你提供的服务和你是干什么的。

I understand that this may sound a little vague. The content of your website, however, is going to largely depend on the type of work and the geographic areas that you are targeting. To put a little more meat on the bone, I’ll use myself as an example.

我知道这听起来可能有一点模糊。然而，网站的大部分内容应该是由你的目标工作类型和地理位置所决定的。为了讲得更清楚一点，我将用自己举例子。

I try to focus my business exclusively on building websites and apps for small to medium sized businesses (I’ve written previously on the importance of choosing a niche). My website focuses exclusively on Ohio and its various cities.

我尽量把业务集中在中小型网站和应用软件的构建上（我之前已经写了选择市场定位的重要性），我的网站专注于俄亥俄州及其各个城市。

I focused my web presence solely on my home state for two reasons. First, if I was trying to compete for Google searches on a national scale, then the competition would be absurd. Going after my home market is a lot more practical.

我的网络形象之所以只关注我的家乡，有两个原因：第一，如果我尝试争夺全国范围内的 Google 搜索量，竞争就会变得很激烈，而追求家乡的市场则要实用得多。

Second, while I get many calls from out of state clients and build products for people all over the country, there are a large number of people who want to stay local when looking for a developer. Also, my website clearly focuses on website or app development, instead of trying to broadly convey everything I could conceivably build.

第二，虽然我能收到很多来自州外客户的电话并为全国范围内的客户做产品，但还有大量想留在当地的人也在寻找开发者。此外，我的网站完全专注在网站和应用程序的开发上，并没有涵盖我能做的所有事情。

So what's been the result of this approach? Well...when I perform an incognito Google search for “Ohio website design” then my site appears first. This means that potential customers call me without my business having to pay for any form of advertising. I also did not pay for advertising for my prior brand, which was acquired earlier in 2020.

那么，这么做给我带来了什么呢？嗯……当我用 Google 搜索“Ohio website design”时，我发现我的网站排在第一位。这意味着我不付费做任何广告，就会有潜在客户给我打电话。我也没有为我的上一个品牌（2020 年初被收购）支付广告费用。

Does my approach result in my website reaching all of the potential customers for all of the work I’m willing to perform? No. Does it reach a high percentage of the people I’m targeting for specific work? Yes.

我的做法有让我的网站被所有的潜在客户访问吗？并没有。但是，我因具体工作而得到目标客户的比例却更高了。

This results in my getting more business through my website than many freelance developers get through theirs. This is why I choose my approach over one which makes it sound like the developer can do nearly anything for anyone regardless of where they are.

这使得我的网站能比很多自由开发者的网站招揽到的生意更多。这就是为什么我选择了我的方式，而没有采用另外一种方式。另外这一种方式听起来就像：开发者几乎可以为任何地方的人做任何事情。

### You must ask satisfied clients to leave you online reviews

### 你要让满意的客户给你留下在线评论

I mentioned above that it is important to set up online review profiles for your business. When you have completed a job for a customer it is important that you ask them to leave you a review.

我在上面有提到过为业务设立在线评论页面的重要性。当你完成了某位客户的工作，请他们给你留下评论非常重要。

The reason for this is simple. The more good reviews you have, then the more you will receive contacts through your website. While having a bank of good reviews doesn’t make more people land on your site, it does make a higher percentage of your website visitors pick up the phone and call.

这么做的理由很简单。你的好评越多，你通过网站收到的联系就越多。虽然大量的好评并不会让更多的人访问你的网站，但它会增大网站访问者拿起电话并打给你的可能性。

Let’s look at a few quick “do’s and don’ts” when it comes to getting reviews.

咱们快速看看要评论时的注意事项。

The first thing to remember when getting reviews is to not ask a client for a review unless you are certain they will leave you a good one. You may have just read that sentence and are now thinking “duh,” but, trust me, you would be surprised at what some people do.

当你请客户为你做评价时，首先要记住的是：若你不能确定某位客户百分百会给你好评，就不要请他进行评价。你可能已经读了这句话，然后在想“这不是废话吗”。但是请相信我，有些人做的事情会让你大吃一惊的。

Second, it’s not enough to ask the customer to leave the review. If you want them to actually do it, you need to call the client and talk to them about leaving you a review. If they are willing to do it, you then want to email them links to your review profiles.

其次，直接叫客户给你留下评价还不够。如果你真想客户这么做，你就要给他们打电话并和他们谈谈给你评价这件事情。如果他们很乐意，你就可以给他们发一封链接到评价页面的邮件。

You will find that doing the phone call and email, in conjunction with one another, will result in a much higher percentage of the people you ask actually following through and leaving the review. Otherwise you’ll ask, and ask, and ask, and few customers will ever actually do it.

你会发现打电话和发邮件可以让你们彼此联系，最终会提升人们给你好评的比例。然而，如果不断地问客户要评价，其实很少有客户会真正去做的。

I can’t stress enough how important a bank of good reviews is to growing your business. Also, just as with web assets which you own (explained above), those good reviews can’t be taken away and don’t require you to pay out money each month.

关于大量的好评对业务扩张的重要性，我已经强调得够多了。就像你拥有的网络资产（上面解释过）一样，这些好评也不会夺走，你也不需要每个月为此支付费用。

Now let’s look at ways to get work in your local market which don’t involve your website.

现在我们来看看如何从本地市场获得工作吧，这些方法与网站的做法不同。

## How to get local clients as a freelance developer

## 自由开发者如何获得本地客户

[back to top][13]

[回到顶部][13]

As I just explained above, a web presence (done correctly) will actually bring in quite a few local clients. There are other things you can do, however, to get clients on the local level.

正如我刚才解释的，一个良好的网络形象实际上并不怎么会给你带来很多本地客户。然而，为了获得本地的客户，你还有一些其它的事情可以做。

These things include talking to larger development shops about outsource/contract opportunities, going out and talking to potential customers one on one, and attending networking functions.

这些事情包括与更大的开发工坊（development shop）谈外包/合同机会，走出去和每个潜在客户谈一谈，以及参加网络集会。

Let’s take a quick look at each of these methods in more detail.

我们迅速深入看一下每种方法。

There are more opportunities than you might realize when it comes to picking up work from other developers. Larger dev shops, which work on large scale projects, often are willing to (or need to) outsource a small component of the project.

当你从其他开发者手中接一些工作时，机会可能比你认为的要多得多。一些从事大型项目的开发工坊通常愿意（或需要）将项目中的一小部分外包出去。

There are several reasons for this. First, they may have a one-time project with which they need help. It may not make sense to hire someone for that one particular thing (since there wouldn’t be a need for the employee once the project is completed) so it makes sense to outsource.

这有几个方面的原因，一是他们可能需要处理一次性项目，为这种事情专门雇个人没什么意义，因为项目完成后就不需要雇的人了，所以外包比较合适。

Second, a larger shop may be in a “middle area” where they are too busy for the amount of staff they have but not busy enough to hire. Again, someone in this situation may outsource. It is common for freelance developers to get work from larger shops who find themselves in this situation.

二是更大的工坊可能会存在“中间地带”：他们现有的员工数量不足以应付，但又不足以雇佣新人。同样，也会有人在这种情况下选择外包。自由开发者从处于这种情况下的工坊获得工作是很普遍的。

The best way to start getting this type of contract work is to reach out to the larger dev shops in your area and introduce yourself. Again (as explained above), you need to have a website, a portfolio, and so on before reaching out. Otherwise they won’t take you seriously.

获取这种合同制工作的最佳方式就是：主动去联系当地的大型开发工坊，然后把你自己介绍给他们。同样（如上所述），在联系前，你需要准备好一个网站，一个作品集等等，否则他们不会认真对待你。

Many freelancers who reach out in this way make what I think is a mistake in that they simply send an email to the head of the larger dev shops. Instead, you want to make sure you are more personal in your approach.

很多通过这种方式进行联系的自由开发者只是给大型开发工坊的老板发邮件，我认为这么做是错误的。相反，你应该确保你的方式更加个性化。

I would suggest calling the head of operations on the phone, explaining who you are, and asking if you can send over a cover letter and resume stating that you are available for outsource work.

我建议你直接给执行领导打电话，告诉他你是谁，然后询问你是否能给他发送一封能表明你可以胜任外包工作的自荐信和简历。

And, importantly, don’t stop there. If the developer doesn’t send you anything right away, I would follow up over the phone once a month or so. Until you’ve been bugging them for a solid year, or until they’ve told you to go away, keep following up in this manner. By showing that you are organized and persistent, you’ll actually manage to get work in this way.

重要的是，不要停滞不前。如果对方没有立即回信，我差不多会每月打一次电话去跟进。坚持用这种方式跟进，直到你烦了他们整整一年或者他们叫你走开。展示出你做事很有条理并且你很执着，实际上你在努力以这种方式获得工作。

Another great way to get customers in your city is to simply meet them one on one. This means walking into local businesses and discussing web services, and so on.

另一种获得同城客户的好方法很简单，就是简单地同他们一一会面。这意味着你要走进当地的商界，讨论网络服务，等等。

Again, many developers who do this tend to go about it wrong. Don’t just go door to door. Make a list of the businesses you intend to visit and actually research them. Look to see if they have a website, organize your thoughts as to how their current web presence can be improved, and also take the time to research their competition.

然而，很多开发者是在用错误的方式做这件事。不要只是挨家挨户的去问，而是先列一个你打算拜访的商业清单，然后仔细研究。看看他们是否有一个网站，好好想一下你如何能提升他们当前的网络形象，记得也花点时间去研究下他们的竞争对手。

Being informed when you go to meet someone will go a long, long, long,........long way. Also, as with local dev shops,  _do not_  be shy about following up until you are specifically told no.

当你去见某人时，等待通知的时间会很长很长。与对当地开发工坊的做法一样，在被明确拒绝之前，_不要_ 害怕去进行跟进。

A third option for getting local clients is to attend networking events. This is something that I’ve suggested before in prior freeCodeCamp articles. This is a good option for quite a few freelancers as many don’t feel comfortable with the more direct approach I just described above.

获取同城客户的第三个选择就是参加网络活动，这也是我之前在 freeCodeCamp 的文章中推荐过的做法。对很多自由开发者来说，这是一个不错的选择，因为很多人会对我刚描述的那些比较直接的做法感到不舒服。

As I said when it comes to creating content, however, stepping out of your comfort zone is important if you want to take your business to the next level. While I believe that the more direct approach is better for getting customers, attending networking groups, such as  [BNI][14]  can yield results as well. It really comes down to how far out of your comfort zone are you willing to go.

正如我在制作内容时所说的那样，如果你想让你的业务更上一层楼，跳出你的舒适区很重要。虽然加入像 [BNI][14] 这样的网络组织也会有结果，但我相信更直接的方式更利于获得客户。这真的取决于你愿意在舒适区外走多远。

## Conclusion

## 结语

By no means is this meant to be an exclusive guide as to how you can get business, both online and in your community. The methods and approaches I've described above, however, have worked for me in my business and have led to my previous brand being acquired.

这篇文章绝对不是要成为开展线上线下业务的独家指南。但是，我在上面所描述的方法和途径不仅在我的业务中奏效了，还让我之前的品牌被收购了。

The last point I’ll make is that your web presence and local reach is the result of the amount of effort you put in it. If you are willing to step out of your comfort zone, and put time into the methods described above, you’ll be ahead of your competition.

我要讲的最一点是：你的网络形象和本地影响力是你投入精力的结果。如果你愿意跳出你的舒适区并花时间实践我上面讲的方法，你就会走在竞争对手之前了。
