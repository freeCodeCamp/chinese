![What is Systems Engineering? A Beginner's Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2022/03/tt.jpeg)

我最近在读 J. Martin 的书《Systems Engineering Guidebook – A Process for Developing Systems and Products》 （系统工程指南--开发系统和产品的过程）。 从中我了解到，系统工程可以降低40%的制造成本——你知道吗？

我以前也不知道。即使在上了一堂以系统工程为主题的课后，我也只有在了解其在现实生活中的应用时才明白其相关性。

### But, is systems engineering used in software development?

是的!

一些大名鼎鼎的公司使用系统工程来改进他们的产品。

事实上，谷歌有自己的学科，叫做 [工程生产力](https://landing.google.com/engprod/).

Facebook也有自己的，叫做 [生产工程](https://engineering.fb.com/category/production-engineering/).

另外，亚马逊雇佣了一个 [团队](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/aws-system-development-engineer) 的工程师来帮助建立其云计算基础设施。

为了了解什么是系统工程以及它的重要性，我们来回答四个问题。

1. 什么是系统？
2. 什么是项目的生命周期？
3. 什么是系统工程？
4. 为什么系统工程很重要？

## What is a system?

一个系统是许多 "东西 "的组合，它们像一个整体一样一起工作。

比如说：

- 太阳系统
- 树木
- 公司

这些例子中的每一个都有许多组件（行星、树叶、部门），它们共同构成一个整体。

这些组件也可以是子系统。例如，我们的太阳系有我们的星球。我们的地球有自己的系统，如地圈、生物圈，等等。

地质圈是地球上的一个_子系统_。[2]

有关系统的例子

在编程中，你可以把程序看作是系统。

例如，某个程序中的一个函数可以被看作是系统中的一个元素。

通过为你的程序的不同组成部分布置一个系统，你不仅会做出一个更有效的程序，而且它也会变得更容易维护和在未来添加功能。

因此，你可以把程序的系统看作是其中的一种架构。

这里有一个编程中的系统的例子:

文件树来自 [htm5up 网站模板](https://html5up.net/paradigm-shift)

图片显示了一个网站模板项目的目录（或文件夹）的结构。

许多这些目录包含多个.html、.css和.js文件。

这些文件都有组件和特性，与项目内的其他文件相互作用。从本质上讲，你在这里有一个系统。

整个项目是一个系统。这个项目中的子系统是指方向。一个目录内的每个文件都有许多组件，它们构成了一个项目的整体。

通过学习如何创建一个系统，你将学会如何更好地创建和管理项目。

## What is the lifecycle of a project?

项目的生命周期指的是某个项目的各个阶段——从想法到项目的创建，到最终的使用和最后的制造。

通常情况下，项目的生命周期包括:

1. 构思
2. 创造一个想法
3. 为实际的项目概念创造概念
4. 使用和支持该项目
5. 停用

下面是一个例子，解释了如何应用系统工程为一个公司开发网站。

### Project lifecycle example

假设你正在经营一家软件公司，一个客户要求你为他们公司开发一个网站。

#### Come up with the Idea

Here, you need to have a conversation with the client to determine how the project will be developed, and to learn what the client actually wants from the project.

It is also a good idea to discuss with the client potential future problems that may arise, whether technical or financial.

This is by far the most important phase of the entire lifecycle of the project.

Without understanding the client's needs, you cannot accomplish the projects they want. This is true regardless of your technical knowledge.

#### Create and develop the Idea

The next step is to plan all the steps needed to turn the plan into a real project after understanding the needs of your client.

As an example, you will plan out where you will launch the site, where you will deploy it, and so on.

#### Come up with the concepts for the actual project concept

In this phase, you build the projects the client wants. It is also a critically important step.

It allows you to design the website according to what the client wants.

#### Use and support the project

We are now in the production phase. During this phase, the project will be tested and any technical issues will be fixed.

If there are technical problems, they should be minor, and should not adversely affect the majority of the website.

However, once the project is given to the client, the maintenance should be handled by the client.

#### Deactivation

The website will be deactivated in this final step.

It is either replaced by another site, the client ends their company and takes the site down, and so on.

## What is systems engineering and why does it matter?

We have seen that a system is a combination of many “things” that work together as a whole.

We have also seen that systems have lifecycles.

The act then of planning these lifecycles before starting the project and during its execution is called **systems engineering**.

### Technical example of systems engineering

Let's imagine that you already know what the client wants.

Imagine they've asked you to design an e-commerce site that will host thousands of photos from sellers.

The site needs a central server to host and deliver a lot of images from users. Your site, for instance, may feature images of products it sells.

You need to create an efficient and easy to maintain system that requests images for the website in a short time.

How can you achieve this?

Difficult to answer right? Without a doubt, this is a challenging problem.

One that requires the planning of a system to maximise efficiency and to be as easy as possible to maintain.

If you want to know more about this problem, you can check out [this article](https://www.aosabook.org/en/distsys.html).

Although this is a big technical problem, there are other problems even more serious.

What are the best ways to manage the growth of a large open source library, for example?

How exactly will its architecture be structured, so it is efficient and easy to use?

[Here](https://www.aosabook.org/en/matplotlib.html) is an overview of a popular library architecture in Python, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

You can create and manage the structure of the program when you plan a system.

Thus, the developer won't have to worry about missing functionality goals, serious defects, or spending significantly more than expected on production and maintenance.

It is for this reason that Google, Facebook, Amazon, and many others have dedicated teams of systems engineers.

Through systems engineering, we can develop a kind of "plan" that achieves our goals or the company's goals with near perfection.

## Wrapping up

Well, now you understand:

- What a system is
- What a project lifecycle is
- What systems engineering is and its value in all kinds of projects

Thanks for reading!
