![什么是Web3？解读未来的去中心化网络](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2021/05/web3-future-of-web.jpg)

如果你读到这篇文章，那么你已经是当代互联网世界的一员了。我们现在使用的网络和10年前大不相同。所以，互联网是怎么演化的，更重要的是———接下来它会如何发展？为什么我们需要在意这些问题呢？

历史教会我们，这些变化都会是重要的。

我将在这篇文章里讲述互联网的演化、发展走向，以及为什么了解这些事情很重要。

想象一下网络是如何与你的日常生活息息相关。网络如何改变了社会，还有社交媒体平台、手机应用.....而现在，网络正在经历又一个模式的转换。

## **互联网的演化**

互联网在近年来变化非常大，很多应用都完全脱离[早年](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet)的样子了。互联网的演化一般来说被分为三个阶段：Web 1.0, Web 2.0 和 Web 3.0.

### **什么是 Web 1.0?**

Web 1.0 是互联网的第一个迭代。参与者是消费互联网内容的人群，而创造者是那些典型的网站开发者。当时的网站内容基本只有文字和图片的形式。Web 1.0 大致从1991年延续至2004年。

Web 1.0 时期的网站是由静态网页组成的，并没有动态的html。数据和内容由静态文件系统提供而非数据库，网站也几乎没有交互功能。

你可以把 Web 1.0 当作只读互联网。

### **什么是 Web 2.0?**

我们大多数人主要经历的互联网就是 Web 2.0。你可以把它当作用来互动与社交的网络。

在 Web 2.0 的世界里，你不需要成为一名开发者才能参与创作。 许多应用程序的出现让任何人都能轻松地成为内容创作者。

你可以制作并且向世界分享你的所思所想。你也可以上传一个视频，让成千上万的人看到它，并产生交流和互动评论。

Web 2.0 非常简单，正因为它的简单让越来越多的人更容易地成为创作者。

互联网当前的形式在各方面都非常出色，但在某些领域我们还有很多提升空间。

### **Web 2.0 变现与安全性**

在 Web2 的世界里，大部分流行的应用在它们的生命周期中都遵循一个通用的模式。想一想你日常用的那些应用，以及以下示例如何适用于它们。

#### **应用变现**

想象一下 Instagram、Twitter、LinkedIn 或 YouTube 等流行应用程序的早期阶段，以及如今的它们和当初有多么不同。 这个变化过程通常是这样的：

1. 公司推出应用
2. 它可以吸引尽可能多的用户
3. 然后将其用户群体货币化/变现

当开发人员或公司发布了流行的应用程序时，既然该应用程序的受欢迎程度能不断提高，用户体验通常是非常流畅的。这就是他们能够迅速获得吸引力的主要原因。

起初，许多软件公司并不担心变现问题。他们完全专注于增长和锁定新用户————但最终他们必须开始盈利。

他们还需要考虑外部投资者的作用。 通常，风险投资等的注入会限制我们今天使用的许多应用程序的生命周期，并且最终对用户体验产生负面影响。

如果一家构建应用程序的公司接受风险投资，其投资者通常期望获得数十或数百倍的投资回报。

这意味着，公司通常无法采用原生的可持续增长模式，而是经常被推向两条路径：广告投放或出售个人数据。

对于谷歌、Facebook、Twitter 等许多 web2 公司来说，更多的数据会带来更个性化的广告。 这会带来更多的点击量，并最终带来更多的广告收入。 用户数据的开发利用和集中处理是我们今天所知所用的网络如何运行的核心。

#### **Security and privacy**

Web2 applications repeatedly experience [data breaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches). There are even [websites](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) dedicated to keeping up with these breaches and telling you when your data has been compromised.

In web2, you don’t have any control over your data or how it is stored. In fact, companies often track and save user data without their users' consent. All of this data is then owned and controlled by the companies in charge of these platforms.

Users who live in countries where they have to worry about the negative consequences of free speech are also at risk.

Governments will often shut down servers or seize bank accounts if they believe a person is voicing an opinion that goes against their propaganda. With centralized servers, it is easy for governments to intervene, control, or shut down applications as they see fit.

Because banks are also digital and under centralized control, governments often intervene there as well. They can shut down access to bank accounts or limit access to funds during times of volatility, extreme inflation, or other political unrest.

Web3 aims to solve many of these shortcomings by fundamentally rethinking how we architect and interact with applications from the ground up.

## **What is Web 3.0?**

There are a few fundamental differences between web2 and web3, but decentralization is at its core.

Web3 enhances the internet as we know it today with a few other added characteristics. web3 is:

-   Verifiable
-   Trustless
-   Self-governing
-   Permissionless
-   Distributed and robust
-   Stateful
-   Native built-in payments

In web3, developers don't usually build and deploy applications that run on a single server or that store their data in a single database (usually hosted on and managed by a single cloud provider).

Instead, web3 applications either run on blockchains, decentralized networks of many peer to peer nodes (servers), or a combination of the two that forms a [cryptoeconomic protocol](https://thegraph.com/blog/modeling-cryptoeconomic-protocols-as-complex-systems-part-1). These apps are often referred to as dapps (decentralized apps), and you will see that term used often in the web3 space.

To achieve a stable and secure decentralized network, network participants (developers) are incentivized and compete to provide the highest quality services to anyone using the service.

When you hear about web3, you'll notice that cryptocurrency is often part of the conversation. This is because cryptocurrency plays a big role in many of these protocols. It provides a financial incentive (tokens) for anyone who wants to participate in creating, governing, contributing to, or improving one of the projects themselves.

These protocols may often offer a variety of different services like compute, storage, bandwidth, identity, hosting, and other web services commonly provided by cloud providers in the past.

People can make a living by participating in the protocol in various ways, in both technical and non-technical levels.

Consumers of the service usually pay to use the protocol, similarly to how they would pay a cloud provider like AWS today. Except in web3, the money goes directly to the network participants.

In this, like in many forms of decentralization, you'll see that unnecessary and often inefficient intermediaries are cut out.

Many web infrastructure protocols like [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/blog/filecoin-circulating-supply/), [Livepeer](https://livepeer.com/), [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), and [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/blog/the-graph-grt-token-economics) (which is what I work with at Edge & Node) have issued utility tokens that govern how the protocol functions. These tokens also reward participants at many levels of the network. Even native blockchain protocols like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) operate in this manner.

### **Native payments**

Tokens also introduce a native payment layer that is completely borderless and frictionless. Companies like Stripe and Paypal have created billions of dollars of value in enabling electronic payments.

These systems are overly complex and still do not enable true international interoperability between participants. They also require you to hand over your sensitive information and personal data in order to use them.

Crypto [wallets](https://everest.link/category/0xc00f480db7754ce2e0f992a1080598e53fc511a0/) like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [Torus](https://toruswallet.io/) enable you to integrate easy, anonymous, and secure international payments and transactions into web3 applications.

Networks like Solana offer several hundred digit millisecond latency and transaction costs of a small fraction of a penny. Unlike the current financial system, users do not have to go through the traditional numerous, friction-filled steps to interact with and participate in the network. All they need to do is download or install a wallet, and they can start sending and receiving payments without any gatekeeping.

### **A new way of building companies**

Tokens also brings about the idea of tokenization and the realization of a [token economy](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-the/9781492072973/ch01.html).

Take, for example, the current state of building a software company. Someone comes up with an idea, but in order to start building they need money in order to support themselves.

To get the money, they take on venture capital and give away a percentage of the company. This investment immediately introduces mis-aligned incentives that will, in the long run, not align well with building out the best user experience.

Also, if the company ever does become successful, it will take a very long time for anyone involved to realize any of the value, often leading to years of work without any real return on investment.

Imagine, instead, that a new and exciting project is announced that solves a real problem. Anyone can participate in building it or investing in it from day one. The company announces the release of x number of tokens, and give 10% to the early builders, put 10% for sale to the public, and set the rest aside for future payment of contributors and funding of the project.

Stakeholders can use their tokens to vote on changes to the future of the project, and the people who helped build the project can sell some of their holdings to make money after the tokens have been released.

People who believe in the project can buy and hold ownership, and people who think the project is headed in the wrong direction can signal this by selling their stake.

Because blockchain data is all completely public and open, purchasers have complete transparency over what is happening. This is in contrast to buying equity in private or centralized businesses where many things are often cloaked in secrecy.

This is already happening in the web3 space.

One example is the app [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/blog/introducing-rad.html) (a decentralized GitHub alternative) which allows stakeholders to participate in the [governance](https://everest.link/category/0x46aff9a161267c2c01f5ce1b6e3b717a77f21480/) of their project. [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) is another that allows developers to get paid in cryptocurrency for jumping in and working on Open Source issues. [Yearn](https://docs.yearn.finance/faq#governance) allows stakeholders to participate in decision making and voting on proposals. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/), [SuperRare](https://superrare.com/rare), [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/blog/the-graph-grt-token-economics), [Audius](https://audius.co/), and countless other protocols and projects have issued tokens as a way to enable ownership, participation, and governance.

[DAOs](https://linda.mirror.xyz/Vh8K4leCGEO06_qSGx-vS5lvgUqhqkCz9ut81WwCP2o) (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), which offer an alternative way to build what we traditionally thought of as a company, are gaining tremendous momentum and investment from both traditional developers and venture capital firms.

These types of organizations are tokenized and turn the idea of organizational structure on its head, offering real, liquid, and equitable ownership to larger portions of stakeholders and aligning incentives in new and interesting ways.

For example, [Friends with Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/) is a DAO of web3 builders and artists, is about a year old, has a market cap of around $125 million as of this writing, and recently received [a $10 million round](https://tittlepress.com/crypto/1146487/) of investment from [a16z](https://a16z.com/).

DAOs could encompass an entire post in and of themselves, but for now I'll just say that I think that they are the future of building products and (what we in the past thought of as) companies. [Here is a good post](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw) outlining the current DAO landscape.

### **How Identity Works in Web3**

In web3, [Identity](http://sinahab.com/identity-and-reputation-in-web-3/) also works much differently than what we are used to today. Most of the time in web3 apps, identities will be tied to the wallet address of the user interacting with the application.

Unlike web2 authentication methods like OAuth or email + password (that almost always require users to hand over sensitive and personal information), wallet addresses are completely anonymous unless the user decides to tie their own identity to it publicly.

If the user chooses to use the same wallet across multiple dapps, their identity is also seamlessly transferable across apps, which lets them build up their reputation over time.

Protocols and tools like [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) and [IDX](https://idx.xyz/) already allow developers to build self-sovereign identity into their applications to replace traditional authentication and identity layers. The Ethereum foundation also has [a working RFP](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/sign-in-with-ethereum-RFP) for defining a specification for "Sign in with Ethereum" which would help provide a more streamlined and documented way to do this going forward. [This](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan/status/1402388133086367751) is also a good thread that outlines some of the ways that this would enhance traditional authentication flows.

## **How to Build on Web3**

I'm a developer who recently transitioned into the web3 space from a traditional development background. So I wanted to start building to get a sense of what the development experience felt like. And I wanted to get an understanding of the types of apps that we can build today.

I dove right in and decided to document some of the things I was doing in a couple of blog posts.
